You
be
careful
of
yourself
,
Maggot
!
’
she
called
.
I
wish
I
mean
,
I
hoped
until
this
evening
that
it
was
only
a
joke
,
said
Frodo
.
Those
same
eyes
that
he
had
thought
daunted
and
defeated
,
there
they
were
lit
with
a
fell
light
again
,
clustering
in
her
out
thrust
head
.
At
last
she
spoke
again
.
It
is
a
less
perilous
hunger
.
He
climbed
the
green
barrow
and
laid
them
all
on
top
in
the
sunshine
.
They
ll
be
hunting
for
me
,
he
said
.
Splendid
!
said
Frodo
.
Gollum
paddled
and
scrabbled
in
the
stream
.
Shafts
of
the
sun
flared
above
the
eastern
hills
and
glimmered
on
their
spears
.
The
outstretched
neck
she
clove
asunder
,
and
the
hewn
head
fell
like
a
stone
.
In
what
is
left
,
let
all
who
fight
the
Enemy
in
their
fashion
be
at
one
,
and
keep
hope
while
they
may
,
and
after
hope
still
the
hardihood
to
die
free
.
If
then
you
are
the
Halfling
that
was
named
,
doubtless
you
brought
this
thing
,
whatever
it
may
be
,
to
the
Council
of
which
you
speak
,
and
there
Boromir
saw
it
.
Later
!
Yes
,
when
you
also
have
the
Keys
of
Barad
d
r
itself
,
I
suppose
;
and
the
crowns
of
seven
kings
.
Beren
now
,
he
never
thought
he
was
going
to
get
that
Silmaril
from
the
Iron
Crown
in
Thangorodrim
,
and
yet
he
did
,
and
that
was
a
worse
place
and
a
blacker
danger
than
ours
.
Yet
we
must
move
hence
without
more
delay
.
May
it
serve
you
well
!
Come
!
said
Haldir
.
Suddenly
Bilbo
looked
up
.
On
the
other
side
the
meads
had
become
rolling
downs
of
withered
grass
amidst
a
land
of
fen
and
tussock
.
For
in
the
sixth
circle
,
outside
the
walls
of
the
citadel
,
there
were
some
fair
stables
where
a
few
swift
horses
were
kept
,
hard
by
the
lodgings
of
the
errand
riders
of
the
Lord
:
messengers
always
ready
to
go
at
the
urgent
command
of
Denethor
or
his
chief
captains
.
We
will
see
what
_Doom
,
doom_
came
the
drum
beat
and
the
walls
shook
.
’
Certainly
!
’
said
Frodo
;
but
his
heart
sank
.
I
was
nearly
forgetting
,
’
he
said
.
What
,
teeth
,
nails
,
hair
,
and
all
?
No
,
none
of
that
.
Excellent
!
’
said
Frodo
,
when
he
understood
the
plan
.
They
are
like
great
carrion
birds
.
Yet
the
herdsmen
and
husbandmen
that
dwelt
there
were
not
many
,
and
the
most
part
of
the
people
of
Gondor
lived
in
the
seven
circles
of
the
City
,
or
in
the
high
vales
of
the
mountain
borders
,
in
Lossarnach
,
or
further
south
in
fair
Lebennin
with
its
five
swift
streams
.
He
could
not
speak
.
But
my
patrol
wasn
t
ordered
out
for
another
day
,
nor
any
message
sent
to
Lugb
rz
either
:
owing
to
the
Great
Signal
going
up
,
and
the
High
Nazg
l
going
off
to
the
war
,
and
all
that
.
The
outer
door
could
only
be
reached
by
a
slender
bridge
of
stone
,
without
kerb
or
rail
,
that
spanned
the
chasm
with
one
curving
spring
of
fifty
feet
.
May
your
forest
grow
again
in
peace
.
You
may
think
them
wonderful
,
but
I
have
seen
a
greater
wonder
in
this
land
,
more
beautiful
than
any
grove
or
glade
that
ever
grew
:
my
heart
is
still
full
of
it
.
There
are
many
in
the
River
.
A
false
rumour
that
the
whole
household
was
being
distributed
free
spread
like
wildfire
;
and
before
long
the
place
was
packed
with
people
who
had
no
business
there
,
but
could
not
be
kept
out
.
My
head
grew
clear
,
but
I
was
aching
and
weary
.
He
looked
indisposed
to
see
Sackville
Bagginses
at
any
rate
;
and
he
stood
up
,
fidgeting
with
something
in
his
pocket
.
I
am
not
a
counsellor
.
Of
course
,
my
dear
Frodo
,
it
was
dangerous
for
you
;
and
that
has
troubled
me
deeply
.
Orcs
have
always
behaved
like
that
,
or
so
all
tales
say
,
when
they
are
on
their
own
.
They
looked
hard
at
one
another
.
There
are
few
even
in
Rivendell
that
can
ride
openly
against
the
Nine
;
but
such
as
there
were
,
Elrond
sent
out
north
,
west
,
and
south
.
You
and
the
other
scouts
ought
to
have
your
ears
cut
off
.
They
had
then
walked
almost
eight
leagues
;
and
the
hobbits
could
not
have
gone
any
further
,
even
if
they
had
dared
.
There
he
stood
,
grown
suddenly
tall
,
towering
above
them
.
I
would
now
that
you
had
come
before
,
Gandalf
.
More
than
I
can
,
I
begin
to
feel
.
And
I
had
something
else
to
do
.
So
we
must
still
go
northwards
,
I
think
,
and
see
what
it
is
like
where
the
open
plain
is
narrower
.
owyn
it
was
,
and
Dernhelm
also
.
The
clouds
were
torn
and
drifting
,
and
stars
peeped
out
;
and
above
the
hills
of
the
Coomb
side
the
westering
moon
rode
,
glimmering
yellow
in
the
storm
wrack
.
Down
on
the
Road
,
where
it
swept
to
the
right
to
go
round
the
foot
of
the
hill
,
there
was
a
large
inn
.
Deal
ought
to
have
given
the
ring
to
him
.
Well
,
that
s
that
,
he
said
.
All
right
,
cousin
Frodo
!
You
can
keep
your
secret
for
the
present
,
if
you
want
to
be
mysterious
.
’
Welcome
Gimli
son
of
Gloin
!
It
is
long
indeed
since
we
saw
one
of
Durin’s
folk
in
Caras
Galadhon
.
As
master
of
Bag
End
Frodo
felt
it
his
painful
duty
to
say
good
bye
to
the
guests
.
But
either
the
darkness
had
grown
complete
,
or
else
his
eyes
had
lost
their
sight
.
Soon
Sam
came
to
a
long
flight
of
broad
shallow
steps
.
Gollum
was
by
him
.
And
he
s
gone
off
.
He
crept
slowly
on
,
bent
almost
double
.
At
its
head
there
rode
a
tall
and
evil
shape
,
mounted
upon
a
black
horse
,
if
horse
it
was
;
for
it
was
huge
and
hideous
,
and
its
face
was
a
frightful
mask
,
more
like
a
skull
than
a
living
head
,
and
in
the
sockets
of
its
eyes
and
in
its
nostrils
there
burned
a
flame
.
I
was
half
asleep
when
you
began
,
and
it
seemed
to
follow
on
from
something
that
I
was
dream
ing
about
.
Peaks
of
stone
and
ridges
like
notched
knives
sprang
out
in
staring
black
against
the
uprushing
flame
in
Gorgoroth
.
What
more
do
you
want
to
know
?
The
names
of
all
the
stars
,
and
of
all
living
things
,
and
the
whole
history
of
Middle
earth
and
Over
heaven
and
of
the
Sundering
Seas
laughed
Pippin
.
At
first
the
beauty
of
the
melodies
and
of
the
interwoven
words
in
elven
tongues
,
even
though
he
understood
them
little
,
held
him
in
a
spell
,
as
soon
as
he
began
to
attend
to
them
.
Follow
my
staff
!
’
As
the
wizard
passed
on
ahead
up
the
great
steps
,
he
held
his
staff
aloft
,
and
from
its
tip
there
came
a
faint
radiance
.
frail
and
fleeting
as
little
leaves
,
under
the
enduring
shadow
of
the
sentinels
of
N
menor
.
At
first
he
could
see
little
.
And
we
have
many
of
our
own
,
which
wouldn
t
interest
you
,
perhaps
.
But
the
Great
Rings
,
the
Rings
of
Power
,
they
were
perilous
.
What
a
life
!
But
no
one
at
home
will
ever
believe
me
.
Gate
breaking
?
You
clear
out
,
or
I
ll
break
your
filthy
little
necks
!
Then
he
stopped
,
for
he
had
caught
the
gleam
of
swords
.
A
few
miles
north
,
high
up
in
the
angle
where
the
western
spur
branched
away
from
the
main
range
,
stood
the
old
castle
of
Durthang
,
now
one
of
the
many
orc
holds
that
clustered
about
the
dale
of
Ud
n
.
A
deep
silence
fell
.
And
run
he
did
,
out
of
the
back
door
,
through
the
garden
,
and
over
the
fields
.
His
thought
was
broken
.
The
tricksy
lights
.
The
watchful
eyes
both
of
Saruman
and
of
the
Enemy
are
on
them
.
This
would
mean
crossing
the
Road
,
but
it
was
the
quickest
way
to
more
wooded
country
.
And
they
needed
fuel
;
for
Strider
said
that
Frodo
must
be
kept
warm
,
especially
at
night
,
while
fire
would
be
some
protection
for
them
all
.
On
the
far
side
Merry
and
Pippin
were
set
down
,
and
there
they
waited
with
Legolas
for
the
rest
of
the
Company
to
arrive
.
Moria
!
Moria
!
Wonder
of
the
Northern
world
!
Too
deep
we
delved
there
,
and
woke
the
nameless
fear
.
Caught
between
fire
and
water
,
and
seeing
an
Elf
lord
revealed
in
his
wrath
,
they
were
dismayed
,
and
their
horses
were
stricken
with
mad
ness
.
In
the
west
they
could
not
make
out
either
the
line
of
the
Hedge
or
the
valley
of
the
Brandywine
beyond
it
.
But
they
had
not
gone
more
than
a
furlong
when
the
storm
returned
with
fresh
fury
.
The
Pony
is
a
good
inn
by
all
accounts
.
’
Suddenly
he
stopped
as
if
listening
.
At
least
so
it
is
recorded
,
is
it
not
,
Gimli
?
It
is
,
said
the
dwarf
.
They
had
packs
to
carry
,
and
the
bushes
and
brambles
were
reluctant
to
let
them
through
.
He
held
an
arrow
loosely
in
his
hand
but
did
not
fit
it
to
the
string
.
Tomorrow
we
may
come
this
way
And
take
the
hidden
paths
that
run
Towards
the
Moon
or
to
the
Sun
.
Nothing
remained
of
it
in
his
memory
,
yet
because
of
it
he
felt
glad
and
lighter
of
heart
.
He
fell
and
cut
his
knees
.
He
thought
that
he
had
heard
a
faint
voice
answering
him
.
He
recalled
Bilbo’s
account
of
his
journey
and
the
threatening
towers
on
the
hills
north
of
the
Road
,
in
the
country
near
the
Trolls’
wood
where
his
first
serious
adventure
had
happened
.
Though
at
the
moment
I
feel
more
like
eating
and
drinking
.
If
I
must
go
there
I
wish
I
could
come
there
quickly
and
make
an
end
!
He
shuddered
.
There
were
no
more
sounds
.
I
must
find
Gandalf
at
once
.
The
dark
fire
will
not
avail
you
,
flame
of
Ud
n
.
The
world
has
changed
much
since
I
last
was
on
the
westward
roads
.
The
flet
was
not
at
all
to
their
liking
as
a
bedroom
.
Even
Gimli
,
as
stout
as
any
dwarf
could
be
,
was
grumbling
as
he
trudged
.
But
odd
things
may
happen
to
people
that
have
such
treasures
if
they
use
them
.
So
they
came
to
a
wide
green
land
,
and
beyond
it
was
a
broad
river
in
a
silver
haze
,
out
of
which
rose
a
long
wooded
isle
,
and
many
ships
lay
by
its
shores
.
Something
like
this
:
The
finest
rockets
ever
seen
:
they
burst
in
stars
of
blue
and
green
,
or
after
thunder
golden
showers
came
falling
like
a
rain
of
flowers
.
He
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
But
for
my
part
I
will
risk
no
hurt
to
this
thing
:
of
all
the
works
of
Sauron
the
only
fair
.
Why
are
you
so
unfriendly
?
’
said
Boromir
.
I
have
done
better
,
though
now
I
must
grope
for
spent
arrows
;
all
mine
are
gone
.
’
Only
a
Ranger
!
’
cried
Gandalf
.
We
could
per
haps
find
our
way
through
and
come
round
to
Rivendell
from
the
north
;
but
it
would
take
too
long
,
for
I
do
not
know
the
way
,
and
our
food
would
not
last
.
I
have
tokens
that
I
was
bidden
to
show
to
thee
to
thee
in
especial
,
if
thou
shouldst
dare
to
come
.
I
have
not
had
time
to
learn
gentle
speech
under
your
rod
,
as
you
promised
.
Then
let
us
weigh
the
matter
in
our
minds
,
while
the
others
rest
and
sleep
,
said
Aragorn
.
At
the
day’s
end
they
came
to
a
stream
that
wandered
down
from
the
hills
to
lose
itself
in
the
stagnant
marshland
,
and
they
went
up
along
its
hanks
while
the
light
lasted
.
And
I
believe
them
too
,
whatever
Ted
may
say
.
Along
this
path
the
hobbits
trudged
,
side
by
side
,
unable
to
see
Gollum
in
front
of
them
,
except
when
he
turned
back
to
beckon
them
on
.
Then
she
called
to
each
in
turn
.
The
advancing
hoofs
stopped
short
.
Even
if
he
was
a
day
or
two
behind
us
at
Bree
,
he
could
have
arrived
here
first
.
I
have
heard
his
story
:
how
he
found
it
,
and
how
he
used
it
:
on
his
journey
,
I
mean
.
Five
days
ere
I
set
out
on
this
venture
,
eleven
days
ago
at
about
this
hour
of
the
day
,
I
heard
the
blowing
of
that
horn
:
from
the
northward
it
seemed
,
but
dim
,
as
if
it
were
but
an
echo
in
the
mind
.
They
pushed
,
pulled
,
tore
,
shook
,
and
hammered
;
and
_clang
bang_
,
_crash
crack_
,
in
five
minutes
they
had
these
huge
gates
just
lying
in
ruin
;
and
some
were
already
beginning
to
eat
into
the
walls
,
like
rabbits
in
a
sand
pit
.
Perhaps
it
was
mountains
looming
on
the
verge
of
sight
,
their
jagged
edges
softened
by
wellnigh
twenty
leagues
of
misty
air
;
perhaps
it
was
but
a
cloud
wall
,
and
beyond
that
again
a
yet
deeper
gloom
.
Only
more
orcs
.
For
if
Sauron
of
old
destroyed
the
gardens
,
the
Enemy
today
seems
likely
to
wither
all
the
woods
.
They
were
clad
wholly
in
white
;
and
the
hair
of
the
Lady
was
of
deep
gold
,
and
the
hair
of
the
Lord
Celeborn
was
of
silver
long
and
bright
;
but
no
sign
of
age
was
upon
them
,
unless
it
were
in
the
depths
of
their
eyes
;
for
these
were
keen
as
lances
in
the
starlight
,
and
yet
profound
,
the
wells
of
deep
memory
.
And
if
any
will
bear
him
,
said
omer
.
The
courtyard
lay
in
deep
shadow
,
but
he
could
see
that
the
pavement
was
strewn
with
bodies
.
But
master
will
have
to
go
that
way
.
Nor
do
any
of
us
see
clearly
.
Even
without
a
fog
,
their
sleep
at
mid
day
would
have
prevented
them
from
reaching
it
until
after
nightfall
on
the
day
before
.
It
was
lit
by
silver
lamps
that
swung
from
the
boughs
of
trees
,
and
it
fell
into
a
basin
of
silver
,
from
which
a
white
stream
spilled
.
Then
let
us
avenge
it
,
ere
we
speak
of
it
!
said
Aragorn
,
and
they
rode
back
to
battle
together
.
They
will
come
on
you
in
the
wild
,
in
some
dark
place
where
there
is
no
help
.
It
was
as
shaggy
as
an
old
dog
and
as
lean
as
a
clothes
rail
,
but
it
was
alive
.
It
was
flickering
and
glowing
on
the
walls
away
down
the
passage
before
them
.
There
is
nothing
to
fear
,
said
Faramir
.
They
fell
forward
,
grovelling
heedlessly
on
the
cold
earth
.
Where’s
the
water
?
’
I
don’t
keep
water
in
my
pockets
,
’
said
Frodo
.
Keep
your
hoards
and
your
secrets
hidden
in
the
Accursed
Years
!
Speed
only
we
ask
.
The
strength
was
enough
barely
.
He
slew
the
great_
.
Take
it
!
Frodo
received
it
on
his
shrinking
palm
:
it
seemed
to
have
become
thicker
and
heavier
than
ever
.
You
choose
well
,
said
Th
oden
;
and
I
give
him
now
gladly
.
Evil
dreams
and
evil
waking
were
blended
into
a
long
tunnel
of
misery
,
with
hope
growing
ever
fainter
behind
.
I
beg
you
to
remain
and
ride
with
my
brother
;
for
then
all
our
hearts
will
be
gladdened
,
and
our
hope
be
the
brighter
.
The
eastern
faces
of
the
Ephel
D
ath
were
sheer
,
falling
in
cliff
and
precipice
to
the
black
trough
that
lay
between
them
and
the
inner
ridge
.
I
have
sat
by
your
side
with
Sam
each
day
.
Then
Aragorn
entered
first
and
the
others
followed
.
They
brandished
spears
and
scimitars
which
shone
red
as
blood
in
the
firelight
.
We
lost
them
and
we
cannot
find
them
.
He
longed
only
for
his
master
,
for
one
sight
of
his
face
or
one
touch
of
his
hand
.
And
that
we
called
the
life
of
Men
,
the
way
of
the
world
.
His
few
hours
sleep
had
not
been
nearly
enough
;
he
was
tired
and
rather
dismal
.
The
Elves
made
many
songs
concerning
the
Search
of
the
Ents
,
and
some
of
the
songs
passed
into
the
tongues
of
Men
.
And
our
friends
?
We
found
none
but
Orcs
.
Yess
,
wretched
we
are
,
precious
,
he
whined
.
On
the
last
occasion
he
beat
me
,
and
then
took
me
and
showed
me
to
his
dogs
.
But
this
one
was
as
big
as
an
elm
tree
,
and
walking
walking
seven
yards
to
a
stride
,
if
it
was
an
inch
.
Let
none
say
again
that
Dwarves
are
grasping
and
ungracious
!
Yet
surely
,
Gimli
son
of
Gl
in
,
you
desire
something
that
I
could
give
?
Name
it
,
I
bid
you
!
You
shall
not
be
the
only
guest
without
a
gift
.
You
did
rightly
.
’
He
felt
that
he
was
lying
in
a
soft
slimy
bog
,
and
springing
up
he
set
his
foot
on
the
corner
of
a
cold
hard
flagstone
.
Follow
me
!
he
said
.
Yes
,
lord
.
Health
and
hope
grew
strong
in
them
,
and
they
were
content
with
each
good
day
as
it
came
,
taking
pleasure
in
every
meal
,
and
in
every
word
and
song
.
They
had
not
gone
far
on
the
fifth
day
when
they
left
the
last
straggling
pools
and
reed
beds
of
the
marshes
behind
them
.
I
have
not
seen
these
tokens
before
,
said
Aragorn
.
Dangerous
,
and
probably
useless
;
but
it
must
be
done
.
For
though
we
leave
a
host
of
foes
behind
,
what
matter
?
If
the
Stone
city
falls
,
then
we
shall
have
no
returning
.
He
drew
Sting
from
its
sheath
.
Merry
stepped
forward
.
Let
the
D
nedain
ride
to
him
in
Rohan
!
_
But
whence
this
message
came
they
are
now
in
doubt
.
Please
.
He
will
make
it
yet
.
He
stirred
and
shivered
,
but
he
did
not
look
up
.
It
has
great
virtues
,
but
over
such
a
wound
as
this
its
healing
powers
may
be
small
.
He
sighed
.
I
name
you
Elf
friend
;
and
may
the
stars
shine
upon
the
end
of
your
road
!
Seldom
have
we
had
such
delight
in
strangers
,
and
it
is
fair
to
hear
words
of
the
Ancient
Speech
from
the
lips
of
other
wanderers
in
the
world
.
I
stood
alone
on
an
island
in
the
clouds
;
and
I
had
no
chance
of
escape
,
and
my
days
were
bitter
.
Why
,
they
even
took
Pimple
s
old
ma
,
that
Lobelia
,
and
he
was
fond
of
her
,
if
no
one
else
was
.
The
mist
was
flowing
past
him
now
in
shreds
and
tatters
.
Well
,
what
of
it
?
Did
you
get
any
news
,
any
information
out
of
him
?
Yes
,
a
good
deal
.
They
were
come
to
the
doors
of
Isengard
.
At
length
the
Lady
Galadriel
released
them
from
her
eyes
,
and
she
smiled
.
You
shall
visit
Fangorn
with
me
,
and
then
I
will
come
with
you
to
see
Helm
s
Deep
.
I
don
t
like
it
.
It
was
a
harmless
enough
tale
for
most
of
the
local
hobbits
,
no
doubt
:
just
a
funny
story
about
those
funny
people
away
beyond
the
River
;
but
some
(
old
Butterbur
,
for
instance
)
knew
a
thing
or
two
,
and
had
probably
heard
rumours
long
ago
about
Bilbo
s
vanishing
.
But
not
yet
,
I
beg
,
Master
!
’
cried
Bilbo
.
Nor
have
you
tried
to
take
from
me
what
you
once
sought
.
Fires
now
raged
unchecked
in
the
first
circle
of
the
City
,
and
the
garrison
upon
the
outer
wall
was
already
in
many
places
cut
off
from
retreat
.
It
takes
a
very
heavy
axe
stroke
to
wound
them
seriously
.
None
of
that
!
Hold
your
tongues
.
He
comes
of
age
and
into
his
inheritance
today
.
The
Ents
began
to
murmur
slowly
:
first
one
joined
and
then
another
,
until
they
were
all
chanting
together
in
a
long
rising
and
falling
rhythm
,
now
louder
on
one
side
of
the
ring
,
now
dying
away
there
and
rising
to
a
great
boom
on
the
other
side
.
The
light
was
nearly
gone
,
and
they
were
all
exhausted
,
when
at
last
they
reached
the
top
.
Therefore
they
shall
be
trothplighted
before
you
all
.
The
Ring
!
Is
it
not
a
strange
fate
that
we
should
suffer
so
much
fear
and
doubt
for
so
small
a
thing
?
So
small
a
thing
!
And
I
have
seen
it
only
for
an
instant
in
the
house
of
Elrond
.
and
I
don
t
think
I
can
scramble
among
stones
much
longer
tonight
though
I
grudge
the
delay
.
In
the
afternoon
the
King
s
company
prepared
to
depart
.
I
should
look
well
,
I
don
t
think
I
should
look
right
in
it
,
said
Frodo
.
You
did
not
wish
to
go
home
without
your
master
before
you
looked
in
the
Mirror
,
and
yet
you
knew
that
evil
things
might
well
be
happening
in
the
Shire
.
The
hobbits
were
left
with
the
Isengarders
:
a
grim
dark
band
,
four
score
at
least
of
large
,
swart
,
slant
eyed
Orcs
with
great
bows
and
short
broad
bladed
swords
.
And
if
I
was
like
Gollum
,
he
wouldn
t
wake
up
never
again
.
But
Frodo
sprang
up
,
and
drew
Sting
from
its
sheath
.
Silent
they
stood
now
above
and
spoke
no
word
,
until
Gandalf
stepped
out
upon
the
paved
terrace
at
the
stairs
head
.
And
as
each
length
of
trench
was
completed
,
they
could
see
great
wains
approaching
;
and
soon
yet
more
companies
of
the
enemy
were
swiftly
setting
up
,
each
behind
the
cover
of
a
trench
,
great
engines
for
the
casting
of
missiles
.
For
thus
is
it
spoken
:
_Oft
hope
is
born
,
when
all
is
forlorn_
.
But
it
is
the
Black
Captain
that
defeats
us
.
’
I
had
not
named
you
,
’
said
Elrond
smiling
.
Rings
he
would
give
for
it
,
such
as
he
gave
of
old
.
Then
he
spurred
his
great
horse
right
at
me
,
and
I
jumped
out
of
the
way
only
just
in
time
.
Strider
shall
be
your
guide
.
They
now
marched
on
again
in
silence
,
and
passed
like
shadows
and
faint
lights
:
for
Elves
(
even
more
than
hobbits
)
could
walk
when
they
wished
without
sound
or
footfall
.
I
should
say
:
OUR
birthday
.
But
all’s
well
as
ends
well
;
though
perhaps
we
should
not
say
that
until
we
reach
our
own
doors
.
And
when
Denethor
descended
again
he
went
to
Faramir
and
sat
beside
him
without
speaking
,
but
the
face
of
the
Lord
was
grey
,
more
deathlike
than
his
son
s
.
But
none
to
see
between
here
and
Stone
folk
s
new
walls
.
Far
above
the
rot
and
vapours
of
the
world
the
Sun
was
riding
high
and
golden
now
in
a
serene
country
with
floors
of
dazzling
foam
,
but
only
a
passing
ghost
of
her
could
they
see
below
,
bleared
,
pale
,
giving
no
colour
and
no
warmth
.
Several
of
the
Riders
cried
out
gladly
.
The
ring
beyond
was
filled
with
steaming
water
:
a
bubbling
cauldron
,
in
which
there
heaved
and
floated
a
wreckage
of
beams
and
spars
,
chests
and
casks
and
broken
gear
.
It
could
make
no
further
use
of
him
:
he
was
too
small
and
mean
;
and
as
long
as
it
stayed
with
him
he
would
never
leave
his
deep
pool
again
.
I
wish
I
had
never
seen
the
Ring
!
Why
did
it
come
to
me
?
Why
was
I
chosen
?
Such
questions
cannot
be
answered
,
said
Gandalf
.
Who
would
?
But
the
ques
tion
is
:
who
will
follow
me
,
if
I
lead
you
there
?
’
I
will
,
’
said
Gimli
eagerly
.
Bare
time
was
given
me
to
come
to
your
aid
.
Away
in
the
South
a
dark
patch
appeared
,
and
grew
,
and
drove
north
like
flying
smoke
in
the
wind
.
Then
all
the
more
need
to
fill
our
bottles
,
said
Sam
.
So
long
afterward
a
maker
in
Rohan
said
in
his
song
of
the
Mounds
of
Mundburg
:
We
heard
of
the
horns
in
the
hills
ringing
,
the
swords
shining
in
the
South
kingdom
.
Hullo
!
Good
morning
!
’
said
Bilbo
.
Frodo
crouching
over
his
knees
heard
Sam
in
front
muttering
and
groaning
:
What
a
place
!
What
a
horrible
place
!
Just
let
me
get
out
of
this
boat
,
and
I’ll
never
wet
my
toes
in
a
puddle
again
,
let
alone
a
river
!
’
Fear
not
!
’
said
a
strange
voice
behind
him
.
Do
not
go
that
way
!
But
where
else
will
you
direct
me
?
said
Frodo
.
All
at
once
,
as
if
through
a
gate
of
light
,
the
Road
ran
out
again
from
the
end
of
the
tunnel
into
the
open
.
Get
inside
,
and
be
quick
!
’
Merry
and
Fatty
went
into
the
kitchen
on
the
other
side
of
the
passage
,
and
busied
themselves
with
the
final
preparations
for
a
late
supper
.
He
needs
rest
.
The
Rider
looked
at
them
with
renewed
wonder
,
but
his
eyes
hardened
.
’
Maybe
,
’
said
Boromir
.
Fear
was
ever
in
my
heart
for
my
friends
in
the
Shire
;
but
still
I
had
some
hope
.
The
stone
vanished
with
a
soft
slap
;
but
at
the
same
instant
there
was
a
swish
and
a
bubble
.
’
You
have
seen
Gollum
?
’
exclaimed
Frodo
in
amazement
.
It
seemed
to
be
the
voice
of
Bilbo
chanting
verses
.
But
everywhere
he
looked
he
saw
the
signs
of
war
.
For
into
the
midst
of
all
these
policies
comes
the
Ring
of
Power
,
the
foundation
of
Barad
d
r
,
and
the
hope
of
Sauron
.
Here
the
Snowbourn
flowed
near
to
the
western
walls
of
the
dale
,
and
soon
the
path
led
them
to
a
ford
where
the
shallow
waters
murmured
loudly
on
the
stones
.
I
will
do
what
I
can
but
all
the
more
do
I
urge
you
now
to
go
on
without
rest
.
But
you
speak
of
Master
Gandalf
,
as
if
he
was
in
a
story
that
had
come
to
an
end
.
That
was
the
undoing
of
Saruman
s
plot
.
Hm
,
but
you
_are_
hasty
folk
,
I
see
,
said
Treebeard
.
Out
flew
a
red
golden
dragon
not
life
size
,
but
terribly
life
like
:
fire
came
from
his
jaws
,
his
eyes
glared
down
;
there
was
a
roar
,
and
he
whizzed
three
times
over
the
heads
of
the
crowd
.
Not
yet
?
Not
if
some
better
way
can
be
contrived
?
He
came
and
laid
his
long
hand
on
my
arm
.
Elrond
says
that
the
two
are
akin
,
the
last
strongholds
of
the
mighty
woods
of
the
Elder
Days
,
in
which
the
Firstborn
roamed
while
Men
still
slept
.
A
strong
citadel
it
was
indeed
,
and
not
to
be
taken
by
a
host
of
enemies
,
if
there
were
any
within
that
could
hold
weapons
;
unless
some
foe
could
come
behind
and
scale
the
lower
skirts
of
Mindolluin
,
and
so
come
upon
the
narrow
shoulder
that
joined
the
Hill
of
Guard
to
the
mountain
mass
.
It
looked
like
a
great
rampart
or
sea
wall
whose
foundations
had
shifted
,
so
that
its
courses
were
all
twisted
and
disordered
,
leaving
great
fissures
and
long
slanting
edges
that
were
in
places
almost
as
wide
as
stairs
.
But
I
agree
that
we
can
go
no
further
tonight
.
Well
,
here
we
are
,
and
here
we
must
pass
another
night
,
’
said
Boromir
.
We
could
have
all
come
here
safe
together
,
if
we
had
left
the
Great
River
on
the
second
or
third
day
and
struck
west
.
Once
,
by
accident
it
was
,
wasn
t
it
,
precious
?
Yes
,
by
accident
.
The
chances
were
that
he
and
Merry
would
be
killed
together
with
their
captors
,
before
ever
the
Men
of
Rohan
were
aware
of
them
.
Why
did
you
do
that
?
Worse
than
anything
your
friends
could
have
said
!
You
have
put
your
foot
in
it
!
Or
should
I
say
your
finger
?
’
I
don’t
know
what
you
mean
,
’
said
Frodo
,
annoyed
and
alarmed
.
Off
you
go
,
all
of
you
,
down
the
stairs
!
Wait
a
few
minutes
for
me
at
the
bottom
,
but
if
I
do
not
come
soon
,
go
on
!
Go
quickly
and
choose
paths
leading
right
and
downwards
.
Now
we
must
be
going
on
again
.
As
Sam
,
the
last
of
the
Company
,
led
Bill
up
on
to
the
dry
ground
on
the
far
side
,
there
came
a
soft
sound
:
a
swish
,
followed
by
a
plop
,
as
if
a
fish
had
disturbed
the
still
surface
of
the
water
.
A
special
entrance
was
cut
into
the
bank
leading
to
the
road
,
and
wide
steps
and
a
large
white
gate
were
built
there
.
You
have
become
a
fool
,
Saruman
,
and
yet
pitiable
.
But
hobbits
must
try
some
way
.
In
the
midst
upon
a
stony
height
stands
Dol
Guldur
,
where
long
the
hidden
Enemy
had
his
dwelling
.
His
doubt
will
be
growing
,
even
as
we
speak
here
.
Of
what
tree
growing
in
the
Elvish
country
they
were
made
not
even
Legolas
knew
;
but
the
wood
was
tough
and
yet
strangely
light
.
Indeed
,
in
one
corner
some
of
the
young
Tooks
and
Brandybucks
,
supposing
Uncle
Bilbo
to
have
finished
(
since
he
had
plainly
said
all
that
was
necessary
)
,
now
got
up
an
impromptu
orchestra
,
and
began
a
merry
dance
tune
.
He
turned
away
,
and
the
shadow
passed
.
Then
a
white
fortress
with
seven
towers
.
This
doom
shall
stand
for
a
year
and
a
day
,
and
then
cease
,
unless
you
shall
before
that
term
come
to
Minas
Tirith
and
present
yourself
to
the
Lord
and
Steward
of
the
City
.
Go
to
sleep
!
In
the
end
he
had
to
find
what
he
wanted
for
himself
;
but
he
did
not
have
to
go
far
,
not
out
of
sight
of
the
place
where
his
master
lay
,
still
sleeping
.
Not
that
many
ever
came
back
,
and
not
that
all
they
said
was
believed
:
_news
from
Bree_
,
and
not
_sure
as
Shiretalk_
,
as
the
sayings
go
.
He
lifted
his
heavy
eyes
and
saw
leaning
over
him
a
huge
willow
tree
,
old
and
hoary
.
’
But
that
can
only
mean
going
into
the
Old
Forest
!
’
said
Fredegar
horrified
.
A
little
tent
had
been
pitched
for
him
beside
the
king
s
lodging
;
and
there
he
sat
alone
,
while
men
passed
to
and
fro
,
going
in
to
the
king
and
taking
counsel
with
him
.
How
many
there
were
the
Company
could
not
count
.
Now
therefore
I
must
pronounce
your
doom
.
It
is
early
yet
,
but
here
is
a
newcomer
that
the
Lord
has
taken
into
his
service
.
Leaves
were
whispering
.
Well
,
I
like
that
!
said
Pippin
.
He
guessed
his
master
s
mind
and
came
back
here
before
Frodo
had
gone
.
This
was
the
stroke
of
Frodo’s
sword
,
’
he
said
.
But
if
you
mean
to
help
me
,
I
ought
to
warn
you
that
you
will
be
in
danger
as
long
as
I
am
in
your
house
.
There
was
a
ring
and
clash
of
steel
.
I
think
well
of
you
and
of
the
others
.
This
is
the
Hall
of
Fire
,
’
said
the
wizard
.
It
was
Gandalf
who
roused
them
all
from
sleep
.
Sharp
blades
are
good
to
have
,
if
Shire
folk
go
walking
,
east
,
south
,
or
far
away
into
dark
and
danger
.
So
be
it
!
said
omer
.
He
must
have
taken
it
away
.
The
wind
murmured
in
the
branches
of
the
trees
.
They
kept
as
close
as
they
could
to
the
western
side
,
and
they
could
see
the
dim
shapes
of
the
low
cliffs
rising
ever
higher
,
shadowy
walls
with
their
feet
in
the
hurrying
river
.
I
fear
that
Minas
Tirith
shall
fall
.
They
started
again
before
the
day
was
broad
.
’
It
was
five
miles
or
more
from
Maggot’s
lane
to
the
Ferry
.
Easier
!
he
grunted
.
He
felt
too
comfortable
and
peaceful
to
argue
,
and
in
any
case
he
did
not
think
he
would
get
the
better
of
an
argument
.
Through
the
throat
of
one
huge
leader
Aragorn
passed
his
sword
with
a
thrust
;
with
a
great
sweep
Boromir
hewed
the
head
off
another
.
I
m
coming
down
to
you
,
shouted
Sam
,
though
how
he
hoped
to
help
in
that
way
he
could
not
have
said
.
At
last
the
trumpets
rang
and
the
army
began
to
move
.
Frodo
felt
it
too
.
Far
away
to
the
left
the
river
Entwash
wound
,
a
silver
thread
in
a
green
floor
.
There
came
at
last
a
dreadful
nightfall
;
and
even
as
the
Captains
of
the
West
drew
near
to
the
end
of
the
living
lands
,
the
two
wanderers
came
to
an
hour
of
blank
despair
.
Then
the
Riders
of
the
King
s
House
upon
white
horses
rode
round
about
the
barrow
and
sang
together
a
song
of
Th
oden
Thengel
s
son
that
Gl
owine
his
minstrel
made
,
and
he
made
no
other
song
after
.
They
spent
a
miserable
day
in
this
lonely
and
unpleasant
country
.
Many
of
the
lower
windows
showed
lights
behind
thick
curtains
.
Maybe
,
said
Sam
,
but
I
wouldn
t
be
one
to
say
that
.
He
seemed
to
be
still
standing
on
guard
by
the
closed
door
.
However
,
we
are
certain
of
one
thing
at
any
rate
:
it
will
get
warmer
as
we
get
south
.
The
fruit
was
so
plentiful
that
young
hobbits
very
nearly
bathed
in
strawberries
and
cream
;
and
later
they
sat
on
the
lawns
under
the
plum
trees
and
ate
,
until
they
had
made
piles
of
stones
like
small
pyramids
or
the
heaped
skulls
of
a
conqueror
,
and
then
they
moved
on
.
Yes
,
’
answered
Gandalf
,
he
has
gone
at
last
.
But
for
long
years
we
healers
have
only
sought
to
patch
the
rents
made
by
the
men
of
swords
.
The
westering
sun
was
caught
into
clouds
,
and
night
came
swiftly
.
Beyond
the
ominous
water
were
reared
vast
cliffs
,
their
stern
faces
pallid
in
the
fading
light
:
final
and
impassable
.
Gollum
returned
quietly
and
peered
over
Sam
s
shoulder
.
It
may
well
be
,
O
yes
,
it
may
well
be
that
when
She
throws
away
the
bones
and
the
empty
garments
,
we
shall
find
it
,
we
shall
get
it
,
the
Precious
,
a
reward
for
poor
Sm
agol
who
brings
nice
food
.
Come
on
,
Sam
!
said
Merry
.
But
I
wasn’t
worrying
about
that
.
Over
all
the
leagues
of
waste
before
the
gates
of
Mordor
there
was
a
black
silence
.
But
as
for
the
Fallen
,
when
all
is
made
ready
we
will
return
for
him
;
but
here
let
him
sleep
a
while
.
I
hope
he
hasn’t
done
no
harm
,
sir
,
nor
me
.
No
black
man
shall
pass
my
doors
,
while
I
can
stand
on
my
legs
.
Often
he
chafed
his
master
s
hands
and
feet
,
and
touched
his
brow
,
but
all
were
cold
.
Then
the
kings
of
Gondor
and
Rohan
went
to
the
Hallows
and
they
came
to
the
tombs
in
Rath
D
nen
,
and
they
bore
away
King
Th
oden
upon
a
golden
bier
,
and
passed
through
the
City
in
silence
.
It’s
been
a
queer
day
,
and
no
mistake
.
The
Bree
folk
were
sympathetic
,
but
plainly
not
very
ready
to
take
a
large
number
of
strangers
into
their
little
land
.
But
alas
!
sir
,
we
do
not
keep
this
thing
in
the
Houses
of
Healing
,
where
only
the
gravely
hurt
or
sick
are
tended
.
Their
masters
would
not
dare
to
give
such
plain
orders
to
Orcs
,
even
if
they
knew
so
much
themselves
;
they
would
not
speak
openly
to
them
of
the
Ring
:
they
are
not
trusty
servants
.
Sam
had
changed
before
his
very
eyes
into
an
orc
again
,
leering
and
pawing
at
his
treasure
,
a
foul
little
creature
with
greedy
eyes
and
slobbering
mouth
.
It
was
rough
and
broken
,
fading
to
a
winding
track
between
heather
and
whin
that
thrust
amid
the
cracking
stones
.
Of
the
ten
companions
who
had
survived
the
Battle
of
Five
Armies
seven
were
still
with
him
:
Dwalin
,
Gl
in
,
Dori
,
Nori
,
Bifur
,
Bofur
,
and
Bombur
.
So
Radagast
said
to
me
.
He
isn’t
hesitating
about
which
way
to
go
.
What
s
_The
Pony_
to
him
,
or
mugs
o
beer
?
Not
but
what
my
beer
s
good
,
Gandalf
.
It
would
be
wise
,
Gandalf
.
Come
hither
!
said
Faramir
.
While
they
were
halted
,
the
wind
died
down
,
and
the
snow
slackened
until
it
almost
ceased
.
But
he
may
play
a
part
yet
that
neither
he
nor
Sauron
have
foreseen
.
But
I
knew
in
my
heart
that
he
really
meant
to
go
.
Only
two
or
three
hours
had
passed
,
and
it
was
barely
mid
day
,
when
the
shadowy
shapes
of
the
explorers
appeared
again
.
But
I
saw
him
once
again
,
far
from
here
.
He
looked
indisposed
to
see
Sackville
Bagginses
at
any
rate
;
and
he
stood
up
,
fidgeting
with
something
in
his
pocket
.
Yet
that
was
now
a
day
ago
.
Nay
!
Not
Elves
,
said
the
fourth
,
the
tallest
,
and
as
it
appeared
the
chief
among
them
.
Hurrying
up
they
saw
below
them
a
deep
and
narrow
chan
nel
.
He
found
himself
stiffening
,
as
if
for
a
final
spring
;
he
no
longer
felt
limp
like
a
helpless
prey
.
The
king
is
now
determined
to
set
out
at
once
.
For
myself
I
should
like
a
pipe
to
smoke
in
comfort
,
and
warmer
feet
.
You
are
not
a
very
easy
nut
to
crack
,
and
Gandalf
is
worse
.
Now
we
are
sure
.
Nearly
due
west
the
broad
swath
of
the
marching
Orcs
tramped
its
ugly
slot
;
the
sweet
grass
of
Rohan
had
been
bruised
and
blackened
as
they
passed
.
He
remained
on
visiting
terms
with
his
relatives
(
except
,
of
course
,
the
Sackville
Bagginses
)
,
and
he
had
many
devoted
admirers
among
the
hobbits
of
poor
and
unimportant
families
.
Unsay
?
he
mused
,
as
if
puzzled
.
By
the
White
Hand
!
What
s
the
use
of
sending
out
mountain
maggots
on
a
trip
,
only
half
trained
.
Maybe
the
elven
hoods
defied
his
unseen
eyes
,
and
the
mind
of
his
small
enemy
;
being
strengthened
,
had
turned
aside
his
thought
.
In
any
case
,
they
now
had
so
great
a
dislike
for
that
hollow
place
about
the
stone
that
no
thought
of
remaining
there
was
in
their
minds
.
He
waved
his
hand
,
and
then
turned
and
(
following
Bilbo
,
if
he
had
known
it
)
hurried
after
Peregrin
down
the
garden
path
.
The
song
ended
.
And
here
you
will
find
me
,
walking
and
waiting
,
and
also
looking
east
.
Rope
!
he
muttered
.
Sad
and
sweet
was
the
sound
of
her
voice
in
the
cool
clear
air
:
I
sang
of
leaves
,
of
leaves
of
gold
,
and
leaves
of
gold
there
grew
:
Of
wind
I
sang
,
a
wind
there
came
and
in
the
branches
blew
.
Gently
are
you
revenged
for
my
testing
of
your
heart
at
our
first
meeting
.
But
I
will
now
tell
the
true
story
,
and
if
some
here
have
heard
me
tell
it
otherwise
he
looked
sidelong
at
Gl
in
I
ask
them
to
forget
it
and
forgive
me
.
If
we
make
no
answer
,
the
Enemy
may
move
Men
of
his
rule
to
assail
King
Brand
,
and
D
in
also
.
Already
the
writing
upon
it
,
which
at
first
was
as
clear
as
red
flame
,
fadeth
and
is
now
only
barely
to
be
read
.
Oh
yes
,
he
came
out
.
Frodo
did
not
see
him
again
for
a
long
time
.
Thus
have
I
walked
,
and
thus
now
for
many
years
have
I
slept
,
he
said
,
lest
with
age
the
body
should
grow
soft
and
timid
.
I
think
,
I
think
you
are
not
really
as
you
choose
to
look
.
White
Face
has
vanished
,
my
precious
,
at
last
,
yes
.
But
he
found
Gollum
more
than
he
bargained
for
,
even
taken
like
that
,
suddenly
,
off
his
guard
after
a
fall
.
Death
shall
come
to
any
man
that
draws
Elendil
s
sword
save
Elendil
s
heir
.
There
_is_
a
change
in
him
,
but
just
what
kind
of
a
change
and
how
deep
,
I
m
not
sure
yet
.
Boats
are
quite
tricky
enough
for
those
that
sit
still
without
looking
further
for
the
cause
of
trouble
.
S
is
for
Saruman
,
I
guess
,
he
said
at
length
.
The
hobbits
were
now
wholly
in
the
hands
of
Gollum
.
We
ought
to
be
down
at
least
to
the
level
of
the
Gates
now
.
The
Lord
Faramir
was
walking
alone
in
the
garden
of
the
Houses
of
Healing
,
and
the
sunlight
warmed
him
,
and
he
felt
life
run
new
in
his
veins
;
but
his
heart
was
heavy
,
and
he
looked
out
over
the
walls
eastward
.
But
at
last
she
said
:
Lords
,
you
are
weary
and
shall
now
go
to
your
beds
with
such
ease
as
can
be
contrived
in
haste
.
The
ruffians
gave
back
.
He
was
really
very
kind
to
us
and
did
all
that
he
could
.
I
know
of
them
,
said
Pippin
softly
,
but
I
will
not
speak
of
them
now
,
so
near
,
so
near
.
The
Brown
Lands
rose
into
bleak
wolds
,
over
which
flowed
a
chill
air
from
the
East
.
Most
of
the
things
which
they
had
to
tell
were
a
mere
wonder
and
bewilderment
to
their
host
,
and
far
beyond
his
vision
;
and
they
brought
forth
few
comments
other
than
:
You
don
t
say
;
often
repeated
in
defiance
of
the
evidence
of
Mr.
Butterbur
s
own
ears
.
It
s
dark
,
and
we
cannot
use
the
Lady
s
glass
.
I
might
perhaps
have
consulted
Saruman
the
White
,
but
something
always
held
me
back
.
In
the
meanwhile
,
do
take
care
,
and
don’t
let
out
any
hint
of
where
you
are
going
!
And
see
that
Sam
Gamgee
does
not
talk
.
And
Gandalf
said
:
The
Ring
has
passed
on
,
Bilbo
.
Evidently
there
was
no
wish
for
any
uncanny
events
in
the
Common
Room
again
.
Tonight
we
shall
be
on
our
way
high
up
towards
the
Redhorn
Gate
.
Merry
and
Pippin
suspected
that
he
visited
the
Elves
at
times
,
as
Bilbo
had
done
.
I
found
him
,
sir
,
put
in
Nob
.
Oh
!
That
was
poetry
!
said
Pippin
.
So
the
night
was
not
yet
old
and
for
hours
the
dark
journey
would
go
on
.
Beyond
those
peaks
the
range
bends
round
south
west
.
I
could
stand
there
without
a
hold
.
That
horn
the
eldest
son
of
our
house
has
borne
for
many
generations
;
and
it
is
said
that
if
it
be
blown
at
need
anywhere
within
the
bounds
of
Gondor
,
as
the
realm
was
of
old
,
its
voice
will
not
pass
unheeded
.
Only
so
can
I
see
any
hope
of
doing
my
part
in
the
war
against
Sauron
.
There
are
some
other
signs
near
at
hand
that
you
have
not
considered
.
But
Frodo
quickly
drew
back
the
Ring
.
And
hobbits
as
miserable
slaves
would
please
him
far
more
than
hobbits
happy
and
free
.
Of
course
,
the
Ent
voices
had
stopped
.
Old
knives
are
long
enough
as
swords
for
hobbit
people
,
he
said
.
Yes
,
said
Pippin
;
I
m
afraid
this
is
only
a
passing
gleam
,
and
it
will
all
go
grey
again
.
s
into
Bag
End
.
That
is
his
purpose
.
I
don
t
know
in
the
least
how
far
down
the
Withywindle
we
are
,
or
who
could
possibly
come
here
often
enough
to
make
a
path
along
it
.
Enjoying
your
nice
rest
?
Or
not
?
A
little
awkwardly
placed
,
perhaps
:
swords
and
whips
on
one
side
,
and
nasty
spears
on
the
other
!
Little
people
should
not
meddle
_in
affairs
that
are
too
big
for
them
.
’
I
found
him
,
sir
,
’
put
in
Nob
.
Yes
,
yes
,
agreed
Gollum
,
skipping
about
.
Unless
things
are
altogether
changed
,
eyes
that
know
what
to
look
for
may
discover
the
signs
.
After
several
turns
they
came
to
a
house
close
to
the
wall
of
the
citadel
upon
the
north
side
,
not
far
from
the
shoulder
that
linked
the
hill
with
the
mountain
.
It
is
a
fair
song
in
our
woodland
tongue
;
but
this
is
how
it
runs
in
the
Westron
Speech
,
as
some
in
Rivendell
now
sing
it
.
Look
to
the
boat
!
She
is
too
low
in
the
water
with
all
this
baggage
,
and
the
Great
River
is
swift
.
As
yet
no
gates
had
been
set
up
again
,
but
a
barrier
was
laid
across
the
entrance
to
the
City
,
and
there
stood
men
at
arms
in
silver
and
black
with
long
swords
drawn
.
They
were
behind
him
and
before
him
.
The
road
must
be
trod
,
but
it
will
be
very
hard
.
No
,
we
have
got
no
fish
,
said
Frodo
.
He
is
the
chief
of
my
order
and
the
head
of
the
Council
.
But
there
is
no
need
to
get
angry
.
I
thought
I
was
drowning
,
with
my
friends
and
enemies
and
all
.
But
the
Company
that
I
journeyed
with
had
other
business
.
What
did
that
mean
?
Bregalad
was
standing
up
erect
and
tense
,
looking
back
northwards
towards
Derndingle
.
Now
I
won
t
make
so
bold
as
to
suggest
you
should
come
to
the
Common
Room
tonight
,
said
Butterbur
.
It
seemed
to
me
to
fit
somehow
,
though
I
can’t
explain
.
A
Ring
of
Power
looks
after
itself
,
Frodo
.
Her
long
yellow
hair
rippled
down
her
shoulders
;
her
gown
was
green
,
green
as
young
reeds
,
shot
with
silver
like
beads
of
dew
;
and
her
belt
was
of
gold
,
shaped
like
a
chain
of
flag
lilies
set
with
the
pale
blue
eyes
of
forget
me
nots
.
The
bubbling
hiss
drew
nearer
,
and
there
was
a
creaking
as
of
some
great
jointed
thing
that
moved
with
slow
purpose
in
the
dark
.
It
does
not
seem
to
have
done
you
any
harm
,
said
Aragorn
.
Is
there
some
mightier
sage
,
of
whom
we
have
yet
to
learn
?
It
is
not
wizardry
,
but
a
power
far
older
,
said
Gandalf
:
a
power
that
walked
the
earth
,
ere
elf
sang
or
hammer
rang
.
When
he
returned
to
his
chamber
he
called
for
the
Warden
,
and
heard
all
that
he
could
tell
of
the
Lady
of
Rohan
.
Four
only
were
saved
by
swimming
:
my
brother
and
myself
and
two
others
.
Still
as
stones
they
stood
,
staring
,
waiting
for
they
did
not
know
what
.
And
are
the
others
all
right
?
Yes
,
they
are
all
safe
and
sound
,
answered
Gandalf
.
It
seemed
that
he
was
learned
in
old
lore
,
as
well
as
in
the
ways
of
the
wild
.
What
did
I
tell
you
?
Something
s
happening
!
cried
Sam
.
Boromir
muttered
under
his
breath
,
but
the
echoing
stone
magnified
the
sound
to
a
hoarse
whisper
that
all
could
hear
:
In
the
deep
places
of
the
world
!
And
thither
we
are
going
against
my
wish
.
To
Frodo
it
appeared
that
a
white
light
was
shining
through
the
form
and
raiment
of
the
rider
,
as
if
through
a
thin
veil
.
The
chief
and
master
of
these
was
under
the
Dome
of
Stars
at
Osgiliath
before
its
ruin
.
He
walked
forward
to
the
wall
.
He
would
have
kept
it
for
his
own
,
and
when
he
returned
you
would
not
have
known
your
son
.
It
flows
down
out
of
the
Ettenmoors
,
the
troll
fells
north
of
Rivendell
,
and
joins
the
Loudwater
away
in
the
South
.
For
what
help
is
there
to
send
thither
,
and
how
could
it
come
there
in
time
?
I
have
no
help
to
send
,
therefore
I
must
go
myself
,
said
Aragorn
.
There
was
Bree
blood
in
the
Brandybucks
by
all
accounts
.
’
He
did
,
’
said
Frodo
stiffly
.
Pride
and
hate
were
conquering
him
.
Shadowfax
must
bear
me
now
on
a
swift
errand
.
Perhaps
he
also
thought
that
you
were
Saruman
,
said
Gimli
.
But
I
would
welcome
your
company
.
And
we
must
find
the
path
,
if
we
are
to
pass
Sarn
Gebir
and
come
to
the
Emyn
Muil
.
I
passed
him
on
the
road
.
’
Perilous
indeed
,
’
said
Aragorn
,
fair
and
perilous
;
but
only
evil
need
fear
it
,
or
those
who
bring
some
evil
with
them
.
And
then
all
the
host
of
Rohan
burst
into
song
,
and
they
sang
as
they
slew
,
for
the
joy
of
battle
was
on
them
,
and
the
sound
of
their
singing
that
was
fair
and
terrible
came
even
to
the
City
.
But
my
time
is
coming
.
Huorns
will
help
,
said
Treebeard
.
It
was
not
a
large
meal
(
considering
hobbits
and
the
circumstances
)
,
but
they
felt
much
better
for
it
.
Now
,
therefore
,
things
shall
be
openly
spoken
that
have
been
hidden
from
all
but
a
few
until
this
day
.
Late
in
the
night
he
awoke
.
Who
is
that
?
Frodo
asked
,
when
he
got
a
chance
to
whisper
to
Mr.
Butterbur
.
As
well
set
your
boot
to
the
mountain’s
root
,
For
the
seat
of
a
troll
don’t
feel
it
.
Tell
Gandalf
to
hurry
along
the
East
Road
:
we
shall
soon
be
back
on
it
and
going
as
fast
as
we
can
.
Send
for
my
servants
and
then
go
.
_Doom
,
doom_
went
the
drum
beats
again
:
they
now
sounded
muffled
and
far
away
,
but
they
were
following
.
We
re
going
to
clear
out
these
ruffians
,
and
their
Chief
too
.
But
it
was
the
singing
that
went
to
my
heart
,
if
you
know
what
I
mean
.
I
was
the
herald
of
Gil
galad
and
marched
with
his
host
.
He
had
not
gone
far
before
he
had
shrunk
again
to
a
very
small
and
frightened
hobbit
.
But
Sam
would
have
laughed
,
if
he
had
dared
.
up
from
east
up
the
Silverlode
.
Black
drops
dripped
from
the
blade
and
smoked
on
the
floor
.
Leave
one
!
’
he
said
.
The
valley
seemed
to
stretch
on
endlessly
.
The
orcs
busy
about
the
walls
were
few
and
amazed
,
and
they
were
quickly
slain
or
driven
off
.
How
,
I
wonder
?
And
I
didn
t
like
the
sound
of
what
he
said
about
the
Southfarthing
.
Out
of
the
shadows
of
legend
I
begin
a
little
to
understand
the
marvel
of
the
trees
,
I
think
.
They
were
in
a
wide
hall
with
doors
on
either
side
;
in
front
of
them
a
passage
ran
back
down
the
middle
of
the
house
.
He
realized
now
that
it
was
not
so
:
Gollum
was
feeling
the
terrible
call
of
the
Ring
.
He
could
not
get
rid
of
it
.
Then
_Balin
is
now
lord
of
Moria_
.
I
wonder
what
sort
of
dreams
they
are
having
.
Then
Sauron
returned
.
He
would
not
take
it
,
said
Frodo
.
Are
you
angry
with
me
,
Gandalf
?
he
said
,
as
their
guide
went
out
and
closed
the
door
.
He’s
been
a
bit
queer
lately
,
to
my
mind
.
This
you
know
in
your
heart
.
For
we
reckon
back
our
line
to
Mardil
,
the
good
steward
,
who
ruled
in
the
king
s
stead
when
he
went
away
to
war
.
But
I
have
managed
to
make
a
fair
number
promise
to
come
.
He
stared
down
at
the
hateful
Road
,
leading
back
westward
to
his
home
.
They
still
have
voices
,
and
can
speak
with
the
Ents
that
is
why
they
are
called
Huorns
,
Treebeard
says
but
they
have
become
queer
and
wild
.
For
so
we
have
met
in
time
,
who
otherwise
might
have
met
too
late
.
But
you
commanded
me
to
name
my
desire
.
Great
engines
crawled
across
the
field
;
and
in
the
midst
was
a
huge
ram
,
great
as
a
forest
tree
a
hundred
feet
in
length
,
swinging
on
mighty
chains
.
I
ve
fought
for
the
Tower
against
those
stinking
Morgul
rats
,
but
a
nice
mess
you
two
precious
captains
have
made
of
things
,
fighting
over
the
swag
.
’
It
may
be
all
we
could
wish
,
’
said
Frodo
;
but
it
is
outside
the
Shire
all
the
same
.
Dimly
the
hobbits
could
discern
tall
piers
and
jagged
pinnacles
of
stone
on
either
side
,
between
which
were
great
crevices
and
fissures
blacker
than
the
night
,
where
forgotten
winters
had
gnawed
and
carved
the
sunless
stone
.
He
sighed
,
hoisted
his
pack
,
and
prepared
to
go
out
into
the
ever
gathering
darkness
.
The
ore
fell
with
cloven
head
.
