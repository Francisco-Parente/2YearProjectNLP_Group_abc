But
I
suppose
you
must
take
it
back
.
There
was
no
undergrowth
.
He
climbed
in
those
trees
,
and
he
couldn
t
wash
the
smell
off
his
hands
,
my
nice
hands
.
Day
was
coming
again
in
the
world
outside
,
and
far
beyond
the
glooms
of
Mordor	B-LOC
the
Sun
was
climbing
over
the
eastern
rim
of
Middle	B-LOC	
earth	I-LOC
;
but
here
all
was
still
dark
as
night
.
Now
be
quiet
!
Upon
the
east
too
sheer
and
stony
was
the
valley
s
side
;
upon
the
left
,
from
the
west
,
their
final
doom
approached
.
I
can’t
get
it
now
.
’
He
opened
the
door
,
and
they
followed
him
down
a
short
passage
and
round
a
sharp
turn
.
That
night
they
set
a
watch
,
and
Strider	B-PER
,
it
seemed
,
did
not
sleep
at
all
.
The
others
no
doubt
will
make
shift
to
tread
the
path
behind
us
.
Taking
in
folk
off
hand
like
and
eating
extra
food
,
and
all
that
,
said
Hob	B-PER
.
Yet
I
had
caught
no
hint
of
anything
wrong
in
his
voice
or
in
his
eye
at
our
meeting
.
Night
comes
.
’
The
eighth
is
a
dwarf
,
’
said
Legolas	B-PER
.
But
so
far
my
only
thought
has
been
to
get
here
;
and
I
hope
I
shan’t
have
to
go
any
further
.
Does
he
think
that
men
sleep
without
watch
all
night
!
No
,
he
is
gone
,
said
Eowyn	B-PER
turning
away
and
looking
at
the
mountains
dark
against
the
East
and
South
.
Clear
are
thy
eyes
and
bright
thy
breath
!
And
after
what
has
happened
tonight
another
will
come
,
I
think
,
and
swiftly
.
He
was
no
longer
holding
the
Ring
,
but
it
was
there
,
a
hidden
power
,
a
cowing
menace
to
the
slaves
of
Mordor B-LOC
;
and
in
his
hand
was
Sting
,
and
its
light
smote
the
eyes
of
the
orc
like
the
glitter
of
cruel
stars
in
the
terrible
elf
countries
,
the
dream
of
which
was
a
cold
fear
to
all
his
kind
.
Forgive
me
,
but
that
too
must
be
left
at
the
doors
.
said
Merry B-PER
.
And
now
Faramir	B-PER
was
gone
again
.
Otherwise
he
obviously
thought
the
whole
thing
rather
above
my
head
,
and
he
said
that
if
I
had
the
cheek
to
make
verses
about
Earendil	B-PER
in
the
house
of
Elrond	B-PER
,
it
was
my
affair
.
He
has
no
strength
to
match
you
.
said
Gandalf	B-PER
,
and
for
a
moment
it
seemed
that
a
cloud
of
pain
passed
over
his
face
,
and
he
sat
silent
,
looking
old
as
death
.
The
doors
rolled
back
and
a
keen
air
came
whistling
in
.
It
shall
be
,
lord
,
as
you
command
.
letting
his
master
s
legs
dangle
.
If
you
say
that
again
,
I
shall
.
He
stands
a
fair
chance
of
being
spitted
for
an
Orc
,
or
of
being
roasted
by
the	
Yellow	B-PER
Face	I-PER
.
I
reached
here
at
last
by
a
long
hard
road
,
up
the
Hoarwell	B-LOC
and
through
the
Ettenmoors B-LOC
,
and
down
from
the
north
.
O
Lady
clear
!
They
felt
their
way
along
the
water’s
edge
for
some
distance
,
until
they
found
a
small
shallow
bay
.
Very
good
!
They
will
come
soon
and
speak
to
me
here
.
There
are
no
Bagginses	B-PER
here
.
Sam	B-PER
had
changed
before
his
very
eyes
into
an
orc
again
,
leering
and
pawing
at
his
treasure
,
a
foul
little
creature
with
greedy
eyes
and
slobbering
mouth
.
You
seem
to
know
a
lot
,
said
Uglok	B-PER
.
Mr.
The	B-PER
Chief	I-PER
s
up
at
Bag	B-LOC
End	I-LOC
.
And
I
warn
you
that
peril
is
now
both
before
you
and
behind
you
,
and
upon
either
side
.
And
hold
to
your
purpose
!
’
We
will
not
start
until
it
is
fully
dark
,
’
said
Aragorn	B-PER
.
It
did
look
like
home
.
What
have
you
to
say
now
,
Frodo	B-PER
!
He
was
on
a
dark
heath
,
and
there
was
a
strange
salt
smell
in
the
air
.
And
all
the
lands
that
you
see
,
and
those
that
lie
round
about
them
,
shall
be
dwellings
of
Men
.
They
always
wished
to
talk
to
everything
,
the
old
Elves
did
.
He
returned
to
the
bank
,
close
to
where
the
rill
from
the
spring
trickled
out
into
the
River
.
They
felt
that
he
would
know
how
to
deal
with
Black	B-ORG
Riders	I-ORG
,
if
anyone
did
.
If
once
he
could
do
that
impossible
thing
,
then
somehow
the
errand
would
be
accomplished
,
or
so
it
seemed
to
him
in
that
dark
hour
of
weariness
,
still
labouring
in
the
stony
shadows
under
Cirith	B-LOC
Ungol	I-LOC
.
Curtains
of
wind
blown
rain
were
slanting
down
.
The
three
Riders
that
were
still
in
the
midst
of
the
Ford
were
overwhelmed
:
they
disappeared
,
buried
suddenly
under
angry
foam
.
I
wish
that
there
were
leisure
now
to
walk
among
them
:
they
have
voices
,
and
in
time
I
might
come
to
understand
their
thought
.
The
Orcs
must
have
been
aware
from
this
point
that
they
were
pursued
;
they
may
have
made
some
attempt
to
get
their
captives
away
before
they
were
overtaken
.
I
do
not
know
,
but
it
seems
clear
to
me
that
this
is
what
happened
.
Hoom
!
Why
,
it
might
have
been
put
there
a
purpose
!
But
,
of
course
,
I
have
my
price
.
They
will
return
.
Nay
,
not
yet
,
Master
Peregrin	B-PER
!
Then
with
a
rush
it
leaped
across
the
fissure
.
But
in
my
stead
you
shall
go
,
Ring
bearer
,
when
the
time
comes
,
and
if
you
then
desire
it
.
The
Lord
Saruman	B-PER
is
within
;
but
at
the
moment
he
is
closeted
with
one
Wormtongue	B-PER
,
or
doubtless
he
would
be
here
to
welcome
such
honourable
guests
.
Clear
voices
rose
and
fell
in
the
starlit
air
.
It
is
one
thing
to
take
my
young
friends
walking
over
the
Shire	B-LOC
with
me
,
until
we
are
hungry
and
weary
,
and
food
and
bed
are
sweet
.
Yes
,
it
is
all
very
dim
,
and
stuffy
,
in
here
,
said
Pippin	B-PER
.
The
woods
in
the
valley
were
still
leafy
and
full
of
colour
,
and
seemed
peaceful
and
wholesome
.
You
have
had
your
joke
,
and
alarmed
or
offended
most
of
your
relations
,
and
given
the
whole
Shire	B-LOC
something
to
talk
about
for
nine
days
,
or
ninety
nine
more
likely
.
He
thinks
less
than
he
talks
,
and
slower
;
yet
he
can
see
through
a
brick
wall
in
time
(
as
they
say
in
Bree	B-LOC
)
.
We
shall
be
making
an
early
start
.
After
that
journey
,
and
the
road
I
have
trodden
with
this
Company
,
I
do
not
much
doubt
that
I
shall
find
a
way
through
Rohan	B-LOC
,
and
Fangorn	B-LOC
too
,
if
need
be
.
The
narrow
path
now
wound
under
a
sheer
wall
of
cliffs
to
the
left
,
above
which
the
grim
flanks
of
Caradhras	B-LOC
towered
up
invisible
in
the
gloom
;
on
the
right
was
a
gulf
of
darkness
where
the
land
fell
suddenly
into
a
deep
ravine
.
Then
suddenly
,
unable
to
contain
himself
longer
,
he
burst
out
:
Your
bow
,
Legolas	B-PER
!
A
faint
light
grew
in
the
hall
again
.
The
wind
blows
from
the
East
there
,
for
they
look
out
over
the
Dead	B-LOC
Marshes	I-LOC
and
the
Noman	B-LOC
lands	I-LOC
to
Cirith	B-LOC
Gorgor	I-LOC
and
the
black
gates
of
Mordor	B-LOC
.
The
beacons
of
Gondor	B-LOC
are
alight
,
calling
for
aid
.
And
in
that
case
so
is
the
Redhorn	B-LOC
Gate	I-LOC
,
said
Gandalf	B-PER
;
and
how
we
can
get
over
that
without
being
seen
,
I
cannot
imagine
.
Which
shore
will
you
now
take
?
’
Together
they
carried
out
Merry	B-PER
,
Pippin	B-PER
,
and
Sam	B-PER
.
Tom	B-PER
s
words
laid
bare
the
hearts
of
trees
and
their
thoughts
,
which
were
often
dark
and
strange
,
and
filled
with
a
hatred
of
things
that
go
free
upon
the
earth
,
gnawing
,
biting
,
breaking
,
hacking
,
burning
:
destroyers
and
usurpers
.
His
trappings
of
scarlet
and
gold
flapped
about
him
in
wild
tatters
.
And
in
his
arms
before
him
on
his
horse
he
bore
the
body
of
his
kinsman
,
Faramir	B-PER
son
of
Denethor	B-PER
,
found
upon
the
stricken
field
.
As
well
as
we
could
guess
,
there
are
few
left
upon
the
out
wall
,
and
they
are
heedless
,
busy
in
destruction
.
There
was
a
ring
of
metal
.
You
are
always
badgering
me
about
my
ring
;
but
you
have
never
bothered
me
about
the
other
things
that
I
got
on
my
journey
.
Stay
!
Her
long
yellow
hair
rippled
down
her
shoulders
;
her
gown
was
green
,
green
as
young
reeds
,
shot
with
silver
like
beads
of
dew
;
and
her
belt
was
of
gold
,
shaped
like
a
chain
of
flag
lilies
set
with
the
pale
blue
eyes
of
forget
me
nots
.
Merry	B-PER
alone
seemed
fairly
cheerful
.
He
leaped
into
the
waters
,
but
the
Ring
slipped
from
his
finger
as
he
swam
,
and
then
the
Orcs
saw
him
and
killed
him
with
arrows
.
That
s
hard
,
cruel
hard
.
When
winter
passed
,
she
came
again
,
And
her
song
released
the
sudden
spring
,
Like
rising
lark
,
and
falling
rain
,
And
melting
water
bubbling
.
If
that’s
where
you
get
your
news
from
,
you’ll
never
want
for
moonshine
.
After
that
I
shall
have
another
sleep
,
I
think
;
but
I
shan
t
be
able
to
close
my
eyes
until
you
have
finished
the
story
for
me
.
If
we
keep
on
as
we
are
going
we
shall
get
up
into
the
Ettendales	B-LOC
far
north
of
RivendellA	B-LOC
.
Now
,
Sam	B-PER
Gamgee	I-PER
,
this
is
the
end
of
ends
.
Then
by
some
shift
of
airs
all
the
mist
was
drawn
away
like
a
veil
,
and
there
leaned
up
,
as
he
climbed
over
the
rim
of
the
world
,
the
Swordsman
of
the
Sky
,
Menelvagor	B-PER
with
his
shining
belt
.
If
this
nice
friendliness
would
spread
about
in
Mordor	B-LOC
,
half
our
trouble
would
be
over
.
O
!
All
at
once
,
as
if
through
a
gate
of
light
,
the
Road
ran
out
again
from
the
end
of
the
tunnel
into
the
open
.
It
was
hard
to
say
of
what
colour
they
were
:
grey
with
the
hue
of
twilight
under
the
trees
they
seemed
to
be
;
and
yet
if
they
were
moved
,
or
set
in
another
light
,
they
were
green
as
shadowed
leaves
,
or
brown
as
fallow
fields
by
night
,
dusk
silver
as
water
under
the
stars
.
With
that
he
stood
up
and
went
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
gully
again
.
said
Sam	B-PER
.
We
sing
to
thee
In
a
far
land
beyond
the
Sea
.
On
the
land
of
Lorien	B-LOC
there
was
no
stain
.
said
Frodo	B-PER
,
pushing
back
his
chair
.
Each
time
they
climbed
a
ridge
the
breeze
seemed
to
have
grown
less
.
They
ll
wake
too
quick
and
kill
us
,
whined
Smeagol	B-PER
in
a
last
effort
.
he
shouted
wildly
,
like
an
onlooker
at
a
great
race
urging
on
a
runner
who
is
far
beyond
encouragement
.
What
about
?
Come
and
go
as
you
like
,
as
long
as
you
don
t
make
a
noise
.
he
said
.
Faramir	B-PER
took
a
small
nail
knife
from
his
belt
and
handed
it
to
Frodo B-PER
.
Speak
plainer
!
He
will
,
said
Gandalf B-PER
.
That
is
what
he
most
fears
,
I
deem
.
The
grandson
of
Bard	B-PER
the	I-PER
Bowman	I-PER
rules
them
,
Brand	B-PER
son
of
Bain	B-PER
son
of
Bard	B-PER
.
For
though
I
do
not
ask
for
aid
,
we
need
it
.
You
agreed
to
that
,
you
remember
.
He
had
not
come
,
nor
any
of
your
Company	B-ORG
,
when
I
set
out
six
days
ago
.
Ride
on
!
The
orcs
hindered
by
the
mires
that
lay
before
the
hills
halted
and
poured
their
arrows
into
the
defending
ranks
.
Do
you
bring
men
?
Well
,
my
lord
Steward	B-PER
,
it
is
your
task
to
keep
some
kingdom
still
against
that
event
,
which
few
now
look
to
see
.
I
can
still
remember
ten
score
of
them
without
searching
in
my
mind
.
Some
way
ahead
,
a
mile
or
so
,
perhaps
,
was
a
great
grey
wall
,
a
last
huge
upthrusting
mass
of
mountain
stone
.
What
of
the
tale
?
said
Bilbo	B-PER
.
But
I
am
not
in
a
hurry
tonight
.
It
was
then
that
they
dis
covered
that
Boromir	B-PER
,
who
at
first
had
been
sitting
silent
on
the
outside
of
the
circle
,
was
no
longer
there
.
The
forest
where
Faramir	B-PER
had
stood
seemed
empty
and
drear
,
as
if
a
dream
had
passed
.
I
thought
he
was
only
a
Ranger	B-PER
.
First
check
!
In
the
morning
they
went
on
again
,
walking
without
haste
.
Ever
my
heart
rises
as
we
draw
near
the
mountains
.
What
was
the
thing
,
or
were
there
many
of
them
?
I
know
.
He
took
his
master
s
hand
and
bent
over
it
.
I
will
lead
you
now
!
That
has
not
happened
in
this
Forest
since
the
wars
of
Sauron	B-PER
and
the
Men	B-ORG
of	I-ORG
the	I-ORG
Sea	I-ORG
.
But
you
speak
of
him
as
if
he
was
a
friend
.
But
I
do
not
desire
healing
,
she
said
.
We
do
not
want
the
escapes
of
Mirkwood	B-LOC
in
Ithilien	B-LOC
.
I
will
follow
your
lead
now
if
this
last
warning
does
not
move
you
.
Long
she
had
been
in
the
land
of
her
mother’s
kin
,
in
Lorien	B-LOC
beyond
the
mountains
,
and
was
but
lately
returned
to
Rivendell	B-LOC
to
her
father’s
house
.
And
then
we
can
have
some
rest
and
some
sleep
,
said
Sam	B-PER
.
He
remained
on
visiting
terms
with
his
relatives
(
except
,
of
course
,
the
Sackville	B-PER
Bagginses	I-PER
)
,
and
he
had
many
devoted
admirers
among
the
hobbits
of
poor
and
unimportant
families
.
I
regret
to
announce
that
though
,
as
I
said
,
eleventy
one
years
is
far
too
short
a
time
to
spend
among
you
this
is
the
END
.
He
stood
up
and
cast
open
his
long
black
cloak
,
and
behold
!
But
defenders
and
foes
alike
gave
up
the
battle
and
fled
when
we
came
,
crying
out
that
the
King	B-PER
of	I-PER
the	I-PER
Dead	I-PER
was
upon
them
.
So
much
I
have
heard
but
no
more
.
It
has
been
treasured
by
his
heirs
when
all
other
heirlooms
were
lost
;
for
it
was
spoken
of
old
among
us
that
it
should
be
made
again
when
the
Ring
,
Isildur	B-PER
s
Bane
,
was
found
.
The
wind
had
been
turning
through
north
to
north
west
during
the
night
,
and
now
it
failed
.
He
laughed
again
,
seeing
the
dismay
in
Pippin	B-PER
s
face
.
Regiments
of
black
crows
are
flying
over
all
the
land
between
the
Mountains
and
the
Greyflood	B-LOC
,
he
said
,
and
they
have
passed
over
Hollin	B-LOC
.
I
wonder
where
Isengard	B-LOC
is
?
If
I
understand
aright
all
that
I
have
heard
,
’
he
said
,
I
think
that
this
task
is
appointed
for
you
,
Frodo	B-PER
;
and
that
if
you
do
not
find
a
way
,
no
one
will
.
Maybe
he
was
called
,
said
Theoden	B-PER
;
and
my
heart
tells
me
that
I
shall
not
see
him
again
.
On
down
the
grey
road
they
went
beside
the
Snowbourn	B-LOC
rushing
on
its
stones
;
through
the
hamlets
of
Underharrow	B-LOC
and
Upbourn	B-LOC
,
where
many
sad
faces
of
women
looked
out
from
dark
doors
;
and
so
without
horn
or
harp
or
music
of
men
s
voices
the
great
ride
into
the
East
began
with
which
the
songs
of
Rohan	B-LOC
were
busy
for
many
long
lives
of
men
thereafter
.
he
cried
.
At
last
they
reached
the
crest
of
the
grey
hill
,
and
a
sudden
breeze
blew
in
their
hair
and
stirred
their
cloaks
:
the
chill
wind
of
dawn
.
They
were
the
hobbits
chief
source
of
news
from
distant
parts
if
they
wanted
any
:
as
a
rule
dwarves
said
little
and
hobbits
asked
no
more
.
Some
,
doubtless
,
were
no
better
than
tramps
,
ready
to
dig
a
hole
in
any
bank
and
stay
only
as
long
as
it
suited
them
.
Sam	B-PER
took
his
master
s
hands
and
laid
them
together
,
palm
to
palm
,
and
kissed
them
;
and
then
he
held
them
gently
between
his
own
.
Go
now
?
Many
words
and
few
to
the
point
.
I
d
carry
you
on
my
back
,
if
I
could
.
Sam	B-PER
quickly
blushed
and
hung
his
head
.
They
seem
to
have
made
a
last
stand
by
both
doors
,
he
said
;
but
there
were
not
many
left
by
that
time
.
We
are
Exiles
,
and
most
of
our
kindred
have
long
ago
departed
and
we
too
are
now
only
tarrying
here
a
while
,
ere
we
return
over
the
Great	B-LOC
Sea	I-LOC
.
’
Ah
!
Frodo	B-PER
was
chilled
to
the
marrow
.
even
the
Moon
is
falling
into
gathering
cloud
.
Is
Rivendell	B-LOC
safe
?
Inside
it
was
damp
and
cheerless
,
and
supper
was
served
on
a
long
bare
table
that
had
not
been
scrubbed
for
weeks
.
Indeed
you
look
in
the
bloom
of
health
.
I
do
not
know
if
I
can
do
anything
to
help
you
;
but
I
will
whisper
this
in
your
ears
.
Sit
up
!
I
forgive
you
.
Bill	B-PER
,
seeming
to
understand
well
what
was
going
on
,
nuzzled
up
to
him
,
putting
his
nose
to
Sam’s	B-PER
ear
.
If
they
held
to
their
pace
,
then
at
sundown
yesterday
they
would
reach
the
borders
of
Fangorn	B-LOC
.
Take
it
off
!
I
am
so
torn
between
rage
and
joy
,
that
if
I
do
not
burst
.
White
cloth
may
be
dyed
.
He
bent
over
her
like
a
cloud
,
and
his
eyes
glittered
;
he
raised
his
mace
to
kill
.
The
cold
stone
is
fallen
;
Dark
door
is
standing
wide
;
dead
hand
is
broken
.
But
let
us
not
tarry
here
.
she
said
bitterly
.
Suddenly
he
stopped
and
waved
his
arms
.
But
we
have
got
to
try
and
get
there
;
and
it
won’t
be
done
by
sitting
and
thinking
.
Hence
the
excitement
of
the
hobbit
children
.
Sometimes
in
the
silence
of
that
barren
country
they
fancied
that
they
heard
faint
sounds
behind
them
,
a
stone
falling
,
or
the
imagined
step
of
flapping
feet
on
the
rock
.
Over
we
go
!
He
walked
briskly
back
to
his
hole
,
and
stood
for
a
moment
listening
with
a
smile
to
the
din
in
the
pavilion
and
to
the
sounds
of
merrymaking
in
other
parts
of
the
field
.
It’s
not
his
now
,
but
mine
.
said
Sam	B-PER
pointing
to
the
left
.
Quite
simple
.
Then
Boromir	B-PER
had
come
leaping
through
the
trees
.
Well
,
now
we
must
halt
again
and
wear
the
night
away
.
Travellers
shiver
when
they
see
it
,
they
creep
out
of
sight
,
they
avoid
its
shadow
.
They
rode
across
and
looked
northwards
.
You
make
that
clearer
with
every
word
you
say
.
He
dared
not
open
his
eyes
or
look
up
.
Good
luck
,
Sam	B-PER
!
It
is
well
that
I
did
so
,
for
now
we
have
several
miles
less
to
cross
,
and
haste
is
needed
.
’
He
ran
to
the
ponies
and
before
long
came
back
with
two
tinder
boxes
and
a
hatchet
.
But
anyway
you
do
not
seem
to
fit
in
anywhere
!
He
felt
desperate
:
lost
and
witless
.
They
went
forward
steadily
,
but
they
soon
saw
that
the
Road
was
further
away
than
they
had
imagined
.
I
was
mortally
afraid
,
of
course
;
but
if
I
had
known
more
,
I
should
not
have
dared
even
to
move
.
He
shivered
.
What
are
they
doing
?
she
cried
to
those
about
her
.
I
saw
nothing
,
but
I
didn’t
stop
to
look
.
While
they
were
still
able
to
give
heed
to
such
things
,
they
could
hear
his
breath
hissing
and
gasping
just
in
front
of
them
.
As
far
as
their
eyes
could
reach
,
along
the
skirts
of
the
Morgai	B-LOC
and
away
southward
,
there
were
camps
,
some
of
tents
,
some
ordered
like
small
towns
.
Here
s
my
pretty
lady
!
The
isle
has
fallen
.
Already
in
this
southern
land
they
were
blushing
red
at
their
fingertips
.
The
stroke
on
the
left
might
be
a
G
rune
with
thin
branches
,
’
said
Strider	B-PER
.
We
must
be
getting
off
at
once
.
Some
of
us
are
still
true
Ents
,
and
lively
enough
in
our
fashion
,
but
many
are
growing
sleepy
,
going
tree
ish
,
as
you
might
say
.
Certainly
,
said
Gandalf	B-PER
.
There
was
a
cold
gleam
in
it
.
He
was
a
funny
customer
and
asking
funny
questions
.
But
you
need
ask
no
questions
.
It
is
clad
in
a
forest
of
dark
fir
,
where
the
trees
strive
one
against
another
and
their
branches
rot
and
wither
.
Good
night
!
Again
Gandalf	B-PER
approached
the
wall
,
and
lifting
up
his
arms
he
spoke
in
tones
of
command
and
rising
wrath
.
And
what
was
said
therein
was
already
known
.
But
what
did
I
say
?
Then
they
wrapped
themselves
warmly
,
not
only
in
the
fur
cloaks
of
the
Elves
,
but
in
their
own
blankets
as
well
,
and
tried
to
go
to
sleep
.
It
would
take
more
than
such
an
orc
scratch
to
keep
me
back
.
At
the
feet
of
the
trees
,
and
all
about
the
green
hillsides
the
grass
was
studded
with
small
golden
flowers
shaped
like
stars
.
One
of
you
might
have
fallen
in
and
still
be
wondering
when
you
were
going
to
strike
the
bottom
,
’
said
Aragorn	B-PER
to
Merry	B-PER
.
There
are
some
things
that
it
is
better
to
begin
than
to
refuse
,
even
though
the
end
may
be
dark
.
Then
if
you
will
have
it
so
,
lady
,
he
said
:
you
do
not
go
,
because
only
your
brother
called
for
you
,
and
to
look
on
the
Lord
Aragorn	B-PER
,
Elendil	B-PER
s
heir
,
in
his
triumph
would
now
bring
you
no
joy
.
But
in
this
I
judge
that
you
speak
the
truth
.
I
will
not
speak
of
that
journey
.
Sleepily
he
tried
to
reckon
the
times
and
stages
of
their
journey
,
but
his
memory
was
drowsy
and
uncertain
.
Such
words
and
ifs
are
vain
.
Sam	B-PER
scowled
at
him
,
and
sucked
his
teeth
;
but
he
seemed
to
sense
that
there
was
something
odd
about
his
master
s
mood
and
that
the
matter
was
beyond
argument
.
He
drew
a
deep
breath
.
He
had
a
blue
coat
and
a
long
brown
beard
;
his
eyes
were
blue
and
bright
,
and
his
face
was
red
as
a
ripe
apple
,
but
creased
into
a
hundred
wrinkles
of
laughter
.
Maggots
!
And
the
Eagles
of
the
Mountains
went
far
and
wide
,
and
they
saw
many
things
:
the
gathering
of
wolves
and
the
mustering
of
Ores
;
and
the
Nine	B-PER
Riders	I-PER
going
hither
and
thither
in
the
lands
;
and
they
heard
news
of
the
escape
of
Gollum	B-PER
.
Pippin	B-PER
fell
asleep
,
pillowed
on
a
green
hillock
.
In
panoply
of
ancient
kings
,
in
chain
d
rings
he
armoured
him
;
his
shining
shield
was
scored
with
runes
to
ward
all
wounds
and
harm
from
him
;
his
bow
was
made
of
dragon
horn
,
his
arrows
shorn
of
ebony
,
of
silver
was
his
habergeon
,
his
scabbard
of
chalcedony
;
his
sword
of
steel
was
valiant
,
of
adamant
his
helmet
tall
,
an
eagle
plume
upon
his
crest
,
upon
his
breast
an
emerald
.
But
this
creature
is
in
some
way
bound
up
with
my
errand
.
Then
maybe
you
can
see
it
in
your
mind
s
eye
:
a
great
horn
of
the
wild
ox
of
the
East
,
bound
with
silver
,
and
written
with
ancient
characters
.
And
as
he
waited
,
he
felt
,
more
urgent
than
ever
before
,
the
command
that
he
should
put
on
the
Ring
.
This
is
the
storehouse
and
buttery
of
my
company
of
the
Guard	B-ORG
.
Gandalf	B-PER
passed
now
into
the
wide
land
beyond
the
Rammas	B-LOC
Echor	I-LOC
.
and
ever
they
heard
that
soft
voice
whispering
and
urging
them
.
I
am
getting
very
suspicious
of
this
ForesT
and
everything
in
it
,
and
I
begin
to
believe
all
the
stories
about
it
.
As
if
stricken
by
some
blasting
spell
it
burst
asunder
:
there
was
a
flash
of
searing
lightning
,
and
the
doors
tumbled
in
riven
fragments
to
the
ground
.
They
fool
about
with
boats
on
that
big
river
and
that
isn
t
natural
.
This
is
not
orc
stuff
,
but
man
food
,
as
Treebeard	B-PER
calls
it
.
That
you
need
not
pursue
them
further
,
said
Eomer 	B-PER
.
Frodo	B-PER
gasped
.
So
do
I
,
said
Sam	B-PER
.
’
To
which
the
other
half
of
his
mind
always
replied
:
Not
yet
.
The
gate
opened
and
three
huge
dogs
came
pelting
out
into
the
lane
,
and
dashed
towards
the
travellers
,
barking
fiercely
.
Where
is
this
prisoner
?
In
some
other
time
and
place
Pippin	B-PER
might
have
been
pleased
with
his
new
array
,
but
he
knew
now
that
he
was
taking
part
in
no
play
;
he
was
in
deadly
earnest
the
servant
of
a
grim
master
in
the
greatest
peril
.
In
the
darkness
it
was
hard
to
be
sure
that
they
were
indeed
moving
at
all
;
but
slowly
the
swirl
of
the
water
grew
less
,
and
the
shadow
of
the
eastern
bank
faded
back
into
the
night
.
I
hoped
that
Frodo	B-PER
had
set
forth
at
once
,
as
my
letter
had
urged
,
and
that
he
had
reached
Rivendell	B-LOC
before
the
deadly
pursuit
began
.
Indeed
I
alone
can
aid
you
now
.
Give
it
to
me
!
And
as
he
did
so
a
great
fear
fell
on
all
,
defender
and
foe
alike
;
and
the
hands
of
men
drooped
to
their
sides
,
and
no
bow
sang
.
Wait
a
few
minutes
for
me
at
the
bottom
,
but
if
I
do
not
come
soon
,
go
on
!
I
said
.
But
I
was
not
here
then
.
Even
the
leaves
were
silent
,
and
the
very
falls
seemed
to
be
hushed
.
said
Merry	B-PER
and
Pippin	B-PER
together
,
and
they
turned
away
hastily
.
We
ve
escaped
from
the
Emyn	B-LOC
Muil	I-LOC
!
Whatever
they
have
to
eat
and
drink
,
we
can
t
get
it
.
They
came
a
few
timid
steps
further
into
the
room
,
and
began
to
bow
low
,
feeling
strangely
surprised
and
awkward
,
like
folk
that
,
knocking
at
a
cottage
door
to
beg
for
a
drink
of
water
,
have
been
answered
by
a
fair
young
elf
queen
clad
in
living
flowers
.
Through
Lorien	B-LOC
we
came
of
which
it
were
well
that
you
should
learn
the
truth
ere
you
speak
of
it
again
and
thence
down
the
leagues
of
the
Great
River
to
the
falls
of
Rauros	B-LOC
.
No
word
did
he
ever
speak
of
it
to
any
of
the
Council	B-ORG
.
Frodo	B-PER
was
sitting
at
a
table
with
a
lot
of
papers
in
front
of
him
.
Worm
!
Believe
what
you
will
,
there
is
no
other
way
for
us
unless
you
would
go
back
to
Moria	B-LOC
gate
,
or
scale
the
pathless
mountains
,
or
swim
the
Great
River
all
alone
.
Sam	B-PER
smiled
grimly
at
this
description
of
himself
.
cried
Boromir	B-PER
and
leaped
after
him
.
And
soon
the
word
had
gone
out
from
the
House
that
the
king
was
indeed
come
among
them
,
and
after
war
he
brought
healing
;
and
the
news
ran
through
the
City
.
Overhead
there
hung
a
heavy
roof
,
sombre
and
featureless
,
and
light
seemed
rather
to
be
failing
than
growing
.
Worse
,
there
was
a
whole
line
of
the
ugly
new
houses
all
along
Pool
Side
,
where
the
Hobbiton	B-LOC
Road	I-LOC
ran
close
to
the
bank
.
And
long
listening’s
hungry
work
,
morning
,
noon
,
and
evening
!
To
the
amazement
of
the
others
,
Saruman	B-PER
turned
again
.
The
Lady
Eowyn	B-PER
is
she
,
sister
of
Eomer	B-PER
;
and
we
knew
naught
of
her
riding
until
this
hour
,
and
greatly
we
rue
it
.
Others
were
still
coming
in
by
twos
and
threes
through
a
dark
narrow
door
on
one
side
.
Beside
the
way
in
a
stone
channel
a
stream
of
clear
water
flowed
,
sparkling
and
chattering
.
By
night
they
had
reached
the
feet
of
the
westward
slopes
,
and
there
they
camped
.
For
in
the
days
of
Isildur	B-PER
the
Ruling
Ring
passed
out
of
all
knowledge
,
and
the
Three
were
released
from
its
dominion
.
And
then
Faramir	B-PER
cried
:
Behold
the
King
!
Five
and
forty
leagues
as
the
crow
flies
we
have
come
,
though
many
long
miles
further
our
feet
have
walked
.
He
sprang
forward
to
Boromir’s	B-PER
side
and
drew
himself
up
to
his
full
height
.
I
hope
it
won’t
come
to
that
!
The
growing
light
revealed
to
them
a
land
already
,
less
barren
and
ruinous
.
I
do
not
know
the
reason
for
your
flight
,
and
therefore
I
do
not
know
by
what
means
your
pursuers
will
assail
you
.
’
Where
did
you
learn
such
tales
,
if
all
the
land
is
empty
and
forgetful
?
They
seem
to
like
them
as
much
as
food
,
or
more
.
Yes
,
we
certainly
must
decide
what
to
do
at
once
,
answered
Strider	B-PER
,
looking
up
and
considering
the
time
and
the
weather
.
At
last
they
came
suddenly
into
a
thin
shade
;
great
grey
branches
reached
across
the
path
.
At
that
moment
Boromir	B-PER
reappeared
.
This
is
what
I
have
really
been
longing
for
,
for
years
!
It
fell
upon
his
ears
like
the
echo
of
all
the
joys
he
had
ever
known
.
At
first
it
seemed
to
the
hobbits
that
although
they
walked
and
stumbled
until
they
were
weary
,
they
were
creeping
forward
like
snails
,
and
getting
nowhere
.
I
would
give
them
Bag	B-LOC
End	I-LOC
and
everything
else
,
if
I
could
get
Bilbo	B-PER
back
and
go
off
tramping
in
the
country
with
him
.
Between
them
they
turned
the
whole
place
upside
down
.
How
long
will
the
day
tarry
?
Yes
,
alas
!
I
had
a
funny
dream
an
hour
or
two
before
we
stopped
,
Mr.
They
hate
us
far
more
,
altogether
and
all
the
time
.
But
then
he
turned
aside
.
But
say
on
!
He
came
,
a
weary
man
with
dinted
helm
and
cloven
shield
.
Or
if
you
desire
it
,
we
will
come
to
Rohan	B-LOC
and
bring
him
back
to
rest
with
his
own
people
.
The
wind
s
changing
,
said
Merry	B-PER
.
More
deadly
to
him
was
the
name
of
Elbereth	B-PER
.
They
had
not
gone
far
when
Frodo	B-PER
paused
.
’
Eight
,
’
said
Legolas	B-PER
.
As
they
came
to
the
gates
Cirdan	B-PER
the	I-PER
Shipwright	I-PER
came
forth
to
greet
them
.
He
shuddered
.
To
him
,
I
mean
,
begging
your
pardon
,
Master
Boromir	B-PER
,
’
he
added
,
and
turned
.
I
don
t
know
.
I
was
only
fifty
one
then
,
and
birthdays
did
not
seem
so
important
.
But
you
must
admit
that
it
was
very
intriguing
,
and
I
was
only
in
my
teens
.
It
was
cool
,
as
if
the
sun
had
had
no
power
to
warm
it
;
but
at
that
time
this
seemed
pleasant
.
Well
,
fond
is
not
the
right
word
.
Tell
me
,
Legolas	B-PER
,
why
did
I
come
on
this
Quest
?
Farewell
,
sweet
Nimrodel	B-PER
!
Look
not
too
far
ahead
!
On_
e
step
down
!
Easy
it
is
now
to
guess
how
quickly
the
roving
eye
of
Saruman	B-PER
was
trapped
and
held
;
and
how
ever
since
he
has
been
persuaded
from
afar
,
and
daunted
when
persuasion
would
not
serve
.
By
all
the
signs
,
Captain
Shagrat	B-PER
,
I
d
say
there
s
a
large
warrior
loose
,
Elf
most
likely
,
with
an
elf
sword
anyway
,
and
an
axe
as
well
maybe
:
and
he
s
loose
in
your
bounds
,
too
,
and
you
ve
never
spotted
him
.
But
that
is
another
story
,
which
can
wait
until
after
lunch
.
Crazy
about
stories
of
the
old
days
he
is
,
and
he
listens
to
all
Mr.
Hobbits
give
presents
to
other
people
on
their
own
birthdays
.
The
Elves
were
gone
.
They
re
coming
along
the
road
from
Waymeet	B-LOC
,
but
a
good
many
stray
ruffians
have
joined
up
with
them
.
That
dark
mind
will
be
filled
now
with
the
voice
and
face
of
the
hobbit
and
with
expectation
:
it
may
take
some
time
before
he
learns
his
error
.
For
though
we
leave
a
host
of
foes
behind
,
what
matter
?
Now
I
have
him
at
the
arrow
point
,
said
Anborn	B-PER
.
High
time
!
Here
the
air
was
still
,
stagnant
,
heavy
,
and
sound
fell
dead
.
The
worst
is
now
over
.
.
Wonder
came
into
his
face
,
and
then
he
smiled
in
answer
.
He
rose
clumsily
and
bowed
in
dwarf
fashion
,
saying
:
Yet
more
fair
is
the
living
land
of
Lorien	B-LOC
,
and
the
Lady
Galadriel	B-PER
is
above
all
the
jewels
that
lie
beneath
the
earth
!
And
why
do
you
come
here
?
But
there
is
no
other
way
out
that
I
can
see
or
think
of
.
Long
has
Boromir	B-PER
son
of
Denethor	B-PER
been
gone
seeking
an
answer
,
and
the
horse
that
we
lent
him
came
back
riderless
.
_Still
round
the
corner
there
may
wait
A
new
road
or
a
secret
gate
;
And
though
I
oft
have
passed
them
by
,
A
day
will
come
at
last
when
I
Shall
take
the
hidden
paths
that
run
West
of
the
Moon
,
East
of
the
Sun
.
He
caught
fish
in
deep
pools
with
invisible
fingers
and
ate
them
raw
.
Twilight
was
about
them
as
they
crept
back
to
the
lane
.
I
wondered
if
you
would
turn
up
.
Aragorn	B-PER
nearly
dropped
him
in
his
amazement
.
Even
old
Gandalf	B-PER
.
Away
shall
fade
!
I
am
glad
that
you
are
here
with
me
,
said
Frodo	B-PER
.
’
said
the
Elf
in
a
hissing
whisper
,
and
cast
on
to
the
flet
the
rope
ladder
rolled
up
.
Where
is
that
silly
fellow
,
Merry	B-PER
?
We
ll
see
.
Or
must
I
do
so
myself
?
And
all
those
close
talks
with
Gandalf	B-PER
.
Death
to
the
Strawheads	B-PER
!
Make
for
Rivendell	B-LOC
.
Well
!
Various
reproachful
names
for
himself
came
to
Sam	B-PER
s
mind
,
drawn
from
the
Gaffer	B-PER
s
large
paternal
word
hoard
;
then
it
also
occurred
to
him
that
his
master
had
been
right
:
there
had
for
the
present
been
nothing
to
guard
against
.
So
you
have
come
back
?
For
just
as
Mablung	B-PER
stepped
towards
the
fallen
body
,
there
was
a
new
noise
.
A
cold
wind
flowed
down
behind
them
,
as
they
turned
their
backs
on
the
Redhorn	B-LOC
Gate	I-LOC
,
and
stumbled
wearily
down
the
slope
.
If
we
get
to
the
other
side
of
this
hill
,
we
shall
find
a
spot
that
is
sheltered
and
snug
enough
,
sir
.
Much
like
Gollum	B-PER
with
his
birthday
present
.
Even
as
he
spoke
,
they
saw
,
as
if
she
came
in
answer
to
their
words
,
the
Lady
Galadriel	B-PER
approaching
.
You
re
forgetting
the
great
big
elvish
warrior
that
s
loose
!
Need
we
think
about
it
yet
?
They
could
all
see
him
standing
,
waving
one
hand
in
the
air
,
the
other
was
in
his
trouser
pocket
.
We
have
other
business
.
For
some
years
he
was
quite
happy
and
did
not
worry
much
about
the
future
.
You
are
all
to
walk
free
,
even
the
dwarf
Gimli	B-PER
.
No
it
isn
t
,
said
Frodo	B-PER
.
My
four
legged
friend
;
though
I
seldom
ride
him
,
and
he
wanders
often
far
,
free
upon
the
hillsides
.
The
marshes
were
at
an
end
,
dying
away
into
dead
peats
and
wide
flats
of
dry
cracked
mud
.
As
soon
as
Gandalf	B-PER
reported
that
you
were
recovered
,
the
preparations
began
.
Certainly
he
had
never
faded
.
A
friendly
light
streamed
out
.
I
shan
t
be
doing
anything
of
the
sort
again
,
Mr.
With
that
he
plunged
in
.
A
few
creatures
came
and
looked
at
them
when
the
fire
had
died
away
.
How
I
wish
it
was
all
over
,
and
well
over
!
No
,
I
ll
go
home
by
the
long
road
with
Mr.
For
he
is
very
wise
,
and
weighs
all
things
to
a
nicety
in
the
scales
of
his
malice
.
Then
there
was
a
dull
rumble
and
a
heavy
thud
.
_
What
,
just
in
time
to
meet
Bilbo	B-PER
?
’
For
some
time
Frodo	B-PER
and
Sam	B-PER
managed
to
keep
up
with
the
others
;
but
Aragorn	B-PER
was
leading
them
at
a
great
pace
,
and
after
a
while
they
lagged
behind
.
I
dare
not
take
it
,
not
even
to
keep
it
safe
,
unused
.
All
I
knew
was
that
you
might
be
found
in
a
wild
region
with
the
uncouth
name
of
Shire	B-LOC
.
They
remained
some
days
in
Lothlorien	B-LOC
,
so
far
as
they
could
tell
or
remember
.
Fill
up
while
I
run
and
see
about
some
food
.
And
if
he
were
given
the
Ring
,
he
would
soon
forget
it
,
or
most
likely
throw
it
away
.
White
mists
began
to
rise
and
curl
on
the
surface
of
the
river
and
stray
about
the
roots
of
the
trees
upon
its
borders
.
They
picked
a
way
among
the
trees
,
and
their
ponies
plodded
along
,
carefully
avoiding
the
many
writhing
and
interlacing
roots
.
Sam	B-PER
thought
he
saw
a
last
fleeting
glimpse
of
it
,
peering
back
over
the
edge
of
the
eastward
precipice
,
before
it
ducked
and
disappeared
.
’
he
said
,
bowing
to
the
hobbits
.
The
west
wind
had
shifted
northward
and
it
was
turning
colder
,
but
the
rain
was
gone
.
help
!
’
With
a
sudden
flick
,
quick
as
lightning
,
an
apple
left
his
hand
and
hit
Bill	B-PER
square
on
the
nose
.
But
most
of
the
traffic
went
out
along
the
chief
highway
,
and
that
turned
south
,
and
then
bending
swifter
than
the
River
skirted
the
hills
and
passed
soon
from
sight
.
All
that
day
the
Company	B-ORG
marched
on
,
until
they
felt
the
cool
evening
come
and
heard
the
early
night
wind
whispering
among
many
leaves
.
A
few
low
trees
grew
there
close
to
the
water
,
and
behind
them
rose
a
steep
rocky
bank
.
Baggins	B-PER
,
said
the
leader
of
the
Shirriffs	B-ORG
,
a
two
feather
hobbit
:
You
re
arrested
for
Gate
breaking
,
and
Tearing
up
of
Rules
,
and
Assaulting
Gate
keepers
,
and
Trespassing
,
and
Sleeping
in
Shire	B-LOC
buildings
without
Leave
,
and
Bribing
Guards
with
Food
.
None
has
ever
caught
him
yet
,
for
Tom	B-PER
,
he
is
the
master
:
His
songs
are
stronger
songs
,
and
his
feet
are
faster
.
I
could
not
!
Though
all
is
now
snow
clad
,
our
path
,
as
we
came
up
,
turned
about
that
shoulder
of
rock
down
yonder
.
I
hope
we
shall
meet
again
some
day
,
when
things
are
merry
once
more
,
said
Frodo	B-PER
.
He
got
out
of
bed
and
discovered
that
his
arm
was
already
nearly
as
useful
again
as
it
ever
had
been
.
Now
let
us
take
our
ease
here
for
a
little
!
It
was
like
watching
the
work
of
great
tree
roots
in
a
hundred
years
,
all
packed
into
a
few
moments
.
I
leave
you
in
good
hands
,
better
than
we
hoped
when
we
hunted
the
orcs
to
Fangorn	B-LOC
.
He
recognized
the
voice
of
the
Marshal
,
Elfhelm	B-PER
.
You’ll
find
his
will
and
all
the
other
documents
in
there
,
I
think
,
’
said
the
wizard
.
I
don
t
know
in
the
least
how
far
down
the
Withywindle	B-LOC
we
are
,
or
who
could
possibly
come
here
often
enough
to
make
a
path
along
it
.
I
d
forgotten
it
,
trying
to
find
you
.
But
so
it
was
that
I
came
to
Rivendell	B-LOC
only
three
days
before
the
Ring
,
and
news
of
its
peril
had
already
been
brought
here
which
proved
well
indeed
.
His
attention
seemed
suddenly
to
be
fixed
on
Pippin	B-PER
.
One
of
the
guards
ran
down
the
stair
.
But
you
comfort
me
,
Gimli	B-PER
,
and
I
am
glad
to
have
you
standing
nigh
with
your
stout
legs
and
your
hard
axe
.
Farewell
!
All
right
!
Don
t
follow
them
!
Small
hobbit
children
ran
after
the
cart
all
through
Hobbiton	B-LOC
and
right
up
the
hill
.
But
I
am
sure
I
do
not
know
where
we
shall
find
more
;
for
all
things
are
amiss
in
these
dreadful
days
,
what
with
fires
and
burnings
,
and
the
lads
that
run
errands
so
few
,
and
all
the
roads
blocked
.
’
Frodo	B-PER
and
Sam	B-PER
stopped
dead
,
but
Pippin	B-PER
walked
on
a
few
paces
.
Indeed
I
have
thought
long
about
it
.
Speed
now
,
fair
guests
!
That
must
be
the
stone
that
marked
the
place
where
the
trolls’
gold
was
hidden
.
Yes
,
my
good
Dwarf
,
he
said
,
it
is
a
comfort
not
to
be
mistaken
at
all
points
.
Not
the
day
I
should
have
chosen
for
letting
the
S
.
But
Pippin	B-PER
found
that
for
the
first
time
he
was
close
to
Merry	B-PER
.
’
You
said
I
might
hear
something
to
my
advantage
,
I
believe
,
’
said
Frodo	B-PER
.
For
Isengard	B-LOC
may
be
ruined
,
yet
he
is
still
safe
in
Orthanc	B-LOC
.
I
often
dream
of
it
.
Then
he
sent
plundering
Orcs
,
and
they
carry
off
what
they
can
,
choosing
always
the
black
horses
:
few
of
these
are
now
left
.
Go
with
words
of
guard
and
guiding
on
you
,
he
said
.
’
said
Merry	B-PER
,
looking
in
.
It
is
dangerous
and
narrow
.
and
glittering
caves
,
and
white
towers
and
golden
halls
,
and
battles
,
and
tall
ships
sailing
,
all
these
passed
before
Sam	B-PER
s
mind
until
he
felt
bewildered
.
said
the
old
man
,
coming
towards
them
.
This
is
my
last
word
,
’
he
said
in
a
low
voice
.
For
the
golden
belt
was
given
to
him
in
Lothlorien	B-LOC
by
the
Lady
Galadriel	B-PER
.
Not
so
the
One
.
That
ain
t
no
secret
.
Perhaps
you
are
thinking
it
won’t
be
too
easy
to
get
to
the
Ferry
without
being
caught
?
Wizards
ought
to
know
better
:
they
do
know
better
.
Only
a
little
higher
now
.
’
He
turned
to
go
back
,
and
then
stopped
,
for
he
heard
voices
,
just
round
the
corner
by
the
end
of
Bagshot	B-LOC
Row	I-LOC
.
Wait
!
You
lie
quiet
,
or
you
ll
pay
for
it
!
They
had
eaten
nothing
since
the
early
morning
.
Treebeard	B-PER
was
at
their
head
,
and
some
fifty
followers
were
behind
him
,
two
abreast
,
keeping
step
with
their
feet
and
beating
time
with
their
hands
upon
their
flanks
.
Now
,
if
you
d
brought
him
along
,
that
might
have
been
useful
if
these
Nazgul
are
all
they
make
out
.
Ring
a
dong
!
Helm
!
Standing
upon
the
rim
of
the
ruined
circle
,
they
saw
all
round
below
them
a
wide
prospect
,
for
the
most
part
of
lands
empty
and
featureless
,
except
for
patches
of
woodland
away
to
the
south
,
beyond
which
they
caught
here
and
there
the
glint
of
distant
water
.
It
s
much
lower
here
than
it
was
,
and
it
looks
easier
too
.
So
now
they
crossed
the
stony
bed
and
took
to
the
orc
path
,
and
for
some
time
they
marched
along
it
.
Already
the
eastward
sky
was
turning
pale
;
the
stars
were
fading
,
and
a
grey
light
was
slowly
growing
.
It
seemed
certainly
to
be
Gandalf	B-PER
s
.
All
the
same
,
I
m
beginning
to
feel
that
if
we
ve
got
to
go
on
,
then
we
d
best
get
it
over
.
cried
Gimli	B-PER
.
There’s
been
a
strange
customer
asking
for
Mr.
I
found
this
,
and
I’m
going
to
keep
it
.
Will
you
really
break
the
doors
of
Isengard	B-LOC
?
’
Still
it
might
be
well
for
all
,
’
said
Gloin	B-PER
the
Dwarf
,
if
all
these
strengths
were
joined
,
and
the
powers
of
each
were
used
in
league
.
Strange
are
the
turns
of
fortune
!
My
lord
,
you
called
me
.
These
they
lashed
together
with
bowstrings
,
and
spread
their
cloaks
upon
the
frame
.
Faint
cries
I
heard
,
and
dim
horns
blowing
,
and
a
murmur
as
of
countless
far
voices
:
it
was
like
the
echo
of
some
forgotten
battle
in
the
Dark
Years
long
ago
.
As
he
struggled
on
he
called
again
,
and
kept
on
calling
more
and
more
frantically
;
but
he
heard
no
answer
for
some
time
,
and
then
it
seemed
faint
and
far
ahead
and
high
above
him
.
The
Lord
of
the
Ring
wraiths
had
met
his
doom
.
It
is
not
so
dark
here
,
said
Th
oden
.
Behind
them
the
sinking
Sun
filled
the
cool
western
sky
with
glimmering
gold
.
At
length
after
fifteen
days
of
journey
the
wain
of
King
Theoden	B-PER
passed
through
the
green
fields
of
Rohan	B-LOC
and
came
to
Edoras	B-LOC
;
and
there
they
all
rested
.
He
is
resting
.
Few
years
,
maybe
,
in
other
places
of
less
royalty
,
my
father
answered
.
_The_
Gollum	B-PER
!
They
felt
as
if
a
trap
was
closing
about
them
;
but
they
did
not
quite
lose
heart
.
Soon
the
rabbits
cut
up
lay
simmering
in
their
pans
with
the
bunched
herbs
.
Here
I
set
it
,
he
said
;
but
I
command
you
not
to
touch
it
,
nor
to
permit
any
other
to
lay
hand
on
it
.
This
is
madness
!
We
don
t
know
.
They
looked
up
at
the
grey
and
yellow
leaves
,
moving
softly
against
the
light
,
and
singing
.
But
tomorrow
fairer
housing
shall
be
found
for
you
.
But
how
comes
it
here
?
awake
!
There
lies
the
Mirrormere	B-LOC
,
and
there
the
River	B-LOC
Silverlode	I-LOC
rises
in
its
icy
springs
.
I
knew
that
you
were
coming
,
but
I
was
at
work
up
the
valley
;
there
is
much
still
to
be
done
.
They
will
sing
that
,
and
other
songs
of
the
Blessed B-LOC
Realm   I-LOC
,
many
times
tonight
.
But
now
the
dark
swooping
shadows
were
aware
of
the
newcomer
.
Then
he
remembered
where
he
was
and
lay
down
again
.
Then
he
sat
in
the
largest
chair
and
called
the
hobbits
to
gather
round
him
.
It
rose
up
nearly
to
his
neck
before
he
got
too
far
away
for
me
to
see
him
.
Smagol   B-PER
doesn't
know
,
answered
Gollum   B-PER
.
Men
believed
that
the
Orcs
whom
they
had
slain
were
buried
there
;
but
whether
those
who
had
fled
into
the
wood
were
with
them
,
none
could
say
,
for
no
man
ever
set
foot
upon
that
hill
.
Courage
is
found
in
unlikely
places
,
said
Gildor   B-PER
.
No
,
sir
.
Here
and
there
old
trees
had
been
cut
or
broken
down
,
and
large
rocks
cloven
or
heaved
aside
to
make
a
way
.
The
leaves
of
trees
were
glistening
,
and
every
twig
was
dripping
;
the
grass
was
grey
with
cold
dew
.
Their
weapons
were
taken
from
them
,
and
they
were
roped
together
,
and
marched
off
to
an
empty
hut
that
they
had
built
themselves
,
and
there
they
were
tied
hand
and
foot
,
and
locked
up
under
guard
.
The
last
pages
are
for
you
.
Well
,
I
call
that
very
queer
,
and
indeed
disturbing
,
’
said
Frodo   B-PER
to
himself
,
as
he
walked
towards
his
companions
.
How
long
have
you
known
all
this
?
Go
back
!
Don't
!
Their
land
was
originally
unprotected
from
the
East
;
but
on
that
side
they
had
built
a
hedge
:
the
High    B-LOC
Hay I-LOC
.
Fair
River
daughter
!
You
will
come
to
the
rapids
of
Sarn    B-LOC
Gebir   I-LOC
,
and
maybe
at
last
to
the
great
falls   B-LOC
of  I-LOC
Rauros  I-LOC
where
the
River
thunders
down
from
Nen B-LOC
Hithoel I-LOC
;
and
there
are
other
perils
.
That
may
be
it
.
Tell
us
about
the
Black   B-PER
Riders  I-PER
!
The
Grey    B-PER
Pilgrim I-PER
?
Guard
him
well
,
while
I
am
away
!
Not
even
the
anvils
and
furnaces
of
the
Dwarves
could
do
that
.
And
doughty
Men
too
,
if
I
may
say
it
;
though
lesser
men
with
spades
might
have
served
you
better
.
For
I
have
not
slept
in
such
a
bed
as
this
,
since
I
rode
from
Dunharrow   B-LOC
,
nor
eaten
since
the
dark
before
dawn
.
And
I
am
not
one
either
.
It
will
find
its
way
in
,
and
then
I
shall
drown
.
Why
not
?
For
three
years
after
the
Party
he
had
been
away
.
Far
away
it
seemed
.
And
look
closely
!
They
are
sure
to
have
found
out
which
those
are
.
’
Yet
sworn
word
may
strengthen
quaking
heart
,
’
said
Gimli    B-PER
.
They
would
have
started
earlier
,
only
the
delay
so
plainly
annoyed
the
Shirriff    B-ORG
leader  
.
But
in
metal
work
we
cannot
rival
our
fathers
,
many
of
whose
secrets
are
lost
.
’
said
Frodo   B-PER
,
getting
impatient
with
the
slow
unravelling
of
Butterbur’s   B-PER
thoughts
.
’
I
have
finished
both
now
.
Couldn't
we
sit
here
together
in
the
sun
,
while
it
lasts
?
he
asked
.
Tom   B-PER
can’t
be
always
near
to
open
doors
and
willow
cracks
.
Are
you
trying
to
tell
yourself
you've
got
some
rope
in
your
pocket
?
Grishnkah's B-PER
sword
was
lying
close
at
hand
,
but
it
was
too
heavy
and
clumsy
for
him
to
use
;
so
he
crawled
forward
,
and
finding
the
body
of
the
goblin
he
drew
from
its
sheath
a
long
sharp
knife
.
Time
passed
with
many
cares
,
until
my
doubts
were
awak
ened
again
to
sudden
fear
.
Suddenly
Tom's   B-PER
talk
left
the
woods
and
went
leaping
up
the
young
stream
,
over
bubbling
waterfalls
,
over
pebbles
and
worn
rocks
,
and
among
small
flowers
in
close
grass
and
wet
crannies
,
wandering
at
last
up
on
to
the
Downs   B-LOC
.
Cannot
you
see
him
,
passing
from
tree
to
tree
?
Hobbits
go
home
.
Go
where
you
must
go
,
and
hope
!
Far
off
,
as
in
a
little
picture
drawn
by
elven
fingers
he
saw
the
Lady
Galadriel   B-PER
standing
on
the
grass
in
Lorien  B-LOC
,
and
gifts
were
in
her
hands
.
Anyway
:
there
was
this
Mr.
Frodo   B-PER
left
an
orphan
and
stranded
,
as
you
might
say
,
among
those
queer
Bucklanders B-PER
,
being
brought
up
anyhow
in
Brandy  B-LOC
Hall    I-LOC
.
What
do
you
seek
?
He
will
be
a
hundred
and
thirty
one
!
At
last
the
hobbits
saw
,
rising
dimly
before
them
,
a
steep
dark
land
:
they
had
come
to
the
feet
of
the
mountains
,
and
to
the
green
roots
of
tall
Methedras   B-LOC
.
I'm
here
.
I   
can
see
a
darkness
.
In
Rivendell   B-LOC
there
was
memory
of
ancient
things
;
in
Lorien  B-LOC
the
ancient
things
still
lived
on
in
the
waking
world
.
At
last
they
came
to
The B-LOC
Prancing    I-LOC
Pony    I-LOC
,
and
that
at
least
looked
outwardly
unchanged
;
and
there
were
lights
behind
the
red
curtains
in
the
lower
windows
.
Smeagol B-PER
will
stay
here
:
I
will
stay
here
,
and
the
Yellow  B-PER
Face    I-PER
won't
see
me
.
Tell
us
of
Gil B-PER
galad   I-PER
,
said
Merry   B-PER
suddenly
,
when
he
paused
at
the
end
of
a
story
of
the
Elf B-LOC
Kingdoms    I-LOC
.
It
was
a
bitter
struggle
,
and
the
weariness
is
slow
to
pass
.
Frodo   B-PER
!
And
you
,
Sammie  B-PER
,
don’t
go
ill
treating
my
poor
old
pony
!
Begone
,
and
trouble
me
no
more
!
When
they
came
at
last
to
the
end
of
it
,
Frodo   B-PER
stooped
and
leaned
out
.
Then
they
rested
and
slept
without
fear
upon
the
ground
;
for
their
guides
would
not
permit
them
to
unbind
their
eyes
,
and
they
could
not
climb
.
This
stone
I
gave
to
Celebrian   B-PER
my
daughter
,
and
she
to
hers
;
and
now
it
comes
to
you
as
a
token
of
hope
.
An
exclamation
of
dismay
came
from
the
empty
boat
.
In
that
way
they
would
,
if
all
went
well
,
cut
off
a
great
loop
of
the
Road
,
which
further
on
bent
southwards
to
avoid
the
Midgewater  B-LOC
Marshes I-LOC
.
The
Inn B-LOC
of  I-LOC
Bree    I-LOC
was
still
there
,
however
,
and
the
innkeeper
was
an
important
person
.
What
of
the
Three
Rings
of
the
Elves
?
Light
gleamed
in
a
window
slit
.
But
keep
what
honour
you
may
,
and
do
not
run
!
The
Sun
could
not
watch
me
there
.
No
,
sir
,
of
course
not
.
Twice
Sam B-PER
thought
he
heard
him
speaking
Gandalf's   B-PER
name
.
I
will
go
first
.
said
Aragorn B-PER
,
taking
his
hand
and
kissing
his
brow
.
When
we
leave
here
,
where
there
are
still
a
few
trees
and
bushes
,
each
of
us
should
carry
a
faggot
of
wood
,
as
large
as
he
can
bear
.
No
,
’
said
Gandalf B-PER
,
but
I
can
.
A
deep
loneliness
and
sense
of
loss
was
on
them
.
Such
a
sound
had
not
been
heard
in
those
places
since
Sauron  B-PER
came
to
Middle  B-LOC
earth   I-LOC
.
But
it
was
not
by
design
of
your
own
that
you
became
embroiled
in
them
,
and
so
I
will
not
blame
such
part
as
you
have
played
a
valiant
one
,
I
doubt
not
.
’
That
is
because
you
do
not
understand
and
cannot
imagine
what
lies
ahead
,
’
said
Elrond  B-PER
.
It
is
not
despair
,
for
despair
is
only
for
those
who
see
the
end
beyond
all
doubt
.
Snow
was
thick
on
his
hood
and
shoulders
;
it
was
already
ankle
deep
about
his
boots
.
Sam B-PER
was
silent
,
deep
in
his
memories
.
Some
said
that
it
could
be
seen
,
like
a
great
black
horseman
,
a
dark
shadow
under
the
moon
.
I
have
lost
it
,
Bilbo   B-PER
dear
,
said
Frodo   B-PER
.
We
will
stay
here
for
a
while
.
He
saw
that
riders
away
eastward
were
already
level
with
the
Orcs
,
galloping
over
the
plain
.
Ah
!
I
tried
to
save
the
Shire   B-LOC
,
and
it
has
been
saved
,
but
not
for
me
.
Though
I
m
sure
I
don
t
know
why
he
should
,
sitting
in
his
big
chair
up
in
his
great
castle
,
hundreds
of
miles
away
.
I
knew
the
risk
of
snow
,
though
it
seldom
falls
heavily
so
far
south
,
save
high
up
in
the
mountains
.
I
do
not
wish
for
such
triumphs
,
Frodo   B-PER
son
of
Drogo   B-PER
.
’
they
shouted
,
and
kept
on
repeating
it
in
chorus
,
seeming
reluctant
to
follow
their
own
advice
.
Yes
,
said
Aragorn B-PER
,
we
shall
all
need
the
endurance
of
Dwarves
.
Calling
me
early
aren
t
you
,
Sam B-PER
?
Your
friends
sprang
aside
,
off
the
road
,
or
they
would
have
been
ridden
down
.
Boats
of
the
Elves
would
not
sink
,
maybe
,
he
said
,
but
that
does
not
say
that
we
should
come
through
Sarn    B-LOC
Gebir   I-LOC
alive
.
Farewell
,
and
may
you
find
what
you
seek
!
Saruman B-PER
kept
enough
wisdom
not
to
trust
his
Orcs
.
They
have
not
found
the
Ring
.
When
the
Elves
passed
westward
,
Tom B-PER
was
here
already
,
before
the
seas
were
bent
.
But
what
is
the
good
of
such
honour
?
Gollum  B-PER
watched
every
morsel
from
hand
to
mouth
,
like
an
expectant
dog
by
a
diner
s
chair
.
One
only
of
us
is
an
Elf
,
Legolas B-PER
from
the
Woodland    B-LOC
Realm   I-LOC
in
distant
Mirkwood    B-LOC
.
Many
leagues
,
said
he
,
but
not
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
.
now
!
said
Gandalf B-PER
quietly
as
he
rode
by
Frodo's B-PER
side
.
A
few
of
the
riders
appeared
to
be
bowmen
,
skilled
at
shooting
from
a
running
horse
.
I
do
not
counsel
you
to
leave
the
City
all
unmanned
.
The
wildest
imaginings
that
dark
rumour
had
ever
suggested
to
the
hobbits
fell
altogether
short
of
the
actual
dread
and
wonder
of
Moria   B-LOC
.
He
surveyed
the
green
lawn
,
quickly
but
thoroughly
,
stooping
often
to
the
earth
.
O
my
poor
hands
,
gollum  B-PER
!
Back
to
the
boats
!
Sit
on
the
grass
and
wait
for
the
Whiteskins  B-ORG  
to
join
the
picnic
?
Therein
lies
all
our
hope
.
I
ll
put
red
maggot
holes
in
your
belly
first
.
But
Theoden B-PER
would
not
listen
to
him
,
and
he
went
away
.
The
hobbits
could
hear
no
movements
,
and
after
listening
for
a
while
they
set
off
eastward
at
a
steady
pace
.
I
wish
I
had
waited
for
Gandalf B-PER
,
Frodo   B-PER
muttered
.
The
grots
and
rocky
walls
were
already
starred
with
saxifrages
and
stonecrops
.
So
may
other
things
in
which
you
still
have
trust
.
That
was
on
Wednesday
the
eve
of
the
Party
.
But
Shire   B-LOC
folk
have
been
so
comfortable
so
long
they
don't
know
what
to
do
.
Then
he
paid
Frodo   B-PER
a
brief
visit
,
and
after
taking
a
good
look
at
him
he
went
off
again
.
Go
carefully
with
the
water
,
too
!
’
Has
Gandalf B-PER
told
you
nothing
?
I
asked
.
Only
some
bundle
of
oddments
,
perhaps
,
after
all
,
he
thought
with
a
strange
sense
of
relief
;
but
he
did
not
put
the
bundle
down
again
.
At
once
there
was
great
jostling
and
cursing
as
each
troop
tried
to
get
first
to
the
gate
and
the
ending
of
their
march
.
Gildor  B-PER
said
you
should
take
them
as
was
willing
,
and
you
can't
deny
it
.
Still
,
I
daresay
I
could
get
together
a
fair
company
of
our
younger
folks
if
I
could
make
them
understand
the
need
:
if
I
could
rouse
them
:
we
are
not
a
hasty
folk
.
The
morning
was
passing
towards
noon
,
and
still
the
Company
wandered
and
scrambled
in
a
barren
country
of
red
stones
.
Stand
still
!
’
They
went
along
the
lane
,
until
they
saw
the
thatched
roofs
of
a
large
house
and
farm
buildings
peeping
out
among
the
trees
ahead
.
Here
let
us
hope
that
the
virtue
of
the
Elves
will
keep
us
tonight
from
the
peril
that
comes
behind
.
he
boomed
,
when
he
saw
them
.
said
Pippin  B-PER
.
Still
every
little
is
a
gain
.
But
as
for
your
business
’
He
got
up
and
went
to
the
door
,
opened
it
quickly
and
looked
out
.
I
release
you
from
my
service
,
but
not
from
my
friendship
.
What
are
all
these
queer
goings
on
?
For
of
Beren   B-PER
and
Luthien B-PER
was
born
Dior    B-PER
Thingol’s   I-PER
heir
;
and
of
him
Elwing  B-PER
the
White
whom
Earendil    B-PER
wedded
,
he
that
sailed
his
ship
out
of
the
mists
of
the
world
into
the
seas
of
heaven
with
the
Silmaril
upon
his
brow
.
They
had
drawn
their
knives
and
swords
,
but
hesitated
to
attack
Ugluk   B-PER
.
But
the
Ents    
could
say
more
on
their
side
,
if
they
had
time
!
said
Boromir B-PER
,
that
they
will
buy
their
lives
with
horses
.
said
Aragorn B-PER
.
Wild
Men
say
many
things
he
said
.
Then
I
heard
Bilbo's B-PER
strange
story
of
how
he
had
won
it
,
and
I
could
not
believe
it
.
A
man
came
and
beckoned
to
the
hobbits
,
and
took
them
to
the
recess
at
the
back
of
the
cave
.
Not
very
near
,
and
yet
too
near
,
it
seems
.

It
is
but
a
feint
,
said
Aragorn B-PER
;
and
its
chief
purpose
,
I
deem
,
was
rather
to
draw
us
on
by
a
false
guess
of
our
Enemyes
weakness
than
to
do
us
much
hurt
,
yet
.
Help
!
’
he
cried
.
Even
in
the
Shire   B-LOC
there
are
some
as
like
minding
other
folk
s
business
and
talking
big
.
I
have
known
strong
warriors
of
the
Big
People
who
would
quickly
have
been
overcome
by
that
splinter
,
which
you
bore
for
seventeen
days
.
So
!
Well
,
here
we
are
and
all
ready
,
said
Merry   B-PER
;
but
where
are
the
Doors
?
It
was
after
nightfall
when
,
wet
and
tired
,
the
travellers
came
at
last
to
the
Brandywine  B-LOC
,
and
they
found
the
way
barred
.
When
they
had
stood
silent
for
a
time
beside
the
king
,
Imrahil B-PER
said
:
Where
is
the
Steward B-PER
?
You'd
have
to
get
Strider B-PER
,
Aragorn B-PER
that
is
,
or
old
Mr.
Bilbo   B-PER
,
for
that
.
Now
s
a
chance
to
show
your
quality
.
It
s
not
like
me
,
somehow
,
if
you
understand
.
He
may
watch
all
roads
,
likely
and
unlikely
.
But
Smeagol B-PER
doesn't
mind
.
Yes
,
’
he
answered
.
And
dimly
to
be
seen
were
many
rows
of
tables
,
carved
of
marble
;
and
upon
each
table
lay
a
sleeping
form
,
hands
folded
,
head
pillowed
upon
stone
.
And
I
can
t
wear
orc
mail
over
all
my
clothes
,
can
I
?
Before
they
walked
away
,
they
bowed
low
.
There
Anduin  B-PER
,
going
in
a
wide
knee
about
the
hills
of
Emyn    B-LOC
Arnen   I-LOC
in
South   B-LOC
Ithilien    I-LOC
,
bent
sharply
west
,
and
the
out
wall
rose
upon
its
very
brink
;
and
beneath
it
lay
the
quays
and
landings
of
the
Harlond
for
craft
that
came
upstream
from
the
southern
fiefs
.
cried
Sam B-PER
.
Slowly
the
dawn
grew
to
a
pale
light
,
diffused
and
shadowless
.
It
is
howling
with
wolf
voices
.
Nowhere
are
there
any
men
so
friendly
to
us
as
the
Men
of
Dale    B-LOC
.
Night
under
Night
is
flown
,
and
the
Gate
is
open
!
Merry   B-PER
and
Pippin  B-PER
climbed
the
gate
,
and
the
hobbits
fled
.
When
they
came
to
the
arch
Gandalf B-PER
went
through
,
signing
to
them
to
wait
.
He
was
taking
a
far
greater
risk
than
he
knew
;
but
Frodo   B-PER
was
too
much
occupied
with
his
burden
and
with
the
struggle
in
his
mind
to
debate
,
and
almost
too
hopeless
to
care
.
They
ate
a
very
frugal
supper
(
for
hobbits
)
,
and
then
went
on
again
.
I
wish
then
to
learn
from
you
more
of
it
;
for
what
concerns
Boromir B-PER
concerns
me
.
All
right
!
Here
is
the
Mirror  B-LOC
of  I-LOC
Galadriel   I-LOC   
,
’
she
said
.
They
called
for
more
ale
,
and
began
to
shout
:
Let
s
have
it
again
,
master
!
But
where
is
Aragorn B-PER
?
Of
what
they
brought
to
light
the
Orcs
have
gathered
nearly
all
,
and
given
it
in
tribute
to
Sauron  B-PER
,
who
covets
it
.
asked
Frodo   B-PER
.
The
fourteenth
of
the
New
Year
,
said
Gandalf B-PER
;
or
if
you
like
,
the
eighth
day
of
April
in
the
Shire   B-LOC
reckoning
.
Hobbits
!
He
was
fully
awake
now
,
and
the
memory
of
his
journey
was
returning
:
the
disastrous
short
cut’
through
the
Old B-LOC
Forest  I-LOC
;
the
accident’
at
The B-LOC
Prancing    I-LOC
Pony    I-LOC
.
There
was
no
sign
of
enemies
nor
of
any
challenge
.
No
.
Twas
the
eyes
as
made
me
sit
up
,
so
to
speak
.
Will
you
be
wanting
anything
to
drink
,
masters
?
How
then
do
you
read
this
riddle
?
To
the
end
of
the
journey
in
the
end
,
’
said
Gandalf B-PER
.
And
that
may
well
befall
,
said
Gimli   B-PER
.
’
Whether
because
of
Strider’s   B-PER
skill
or
for
some
other
reason
,
they
saw
no
sign
and
heard
no
sound
of
any
other
living
thing
all
that
day
:
neither
two
footed
,
except
birds
;
nor
four
footed
,
except
one
fox
and
a
few
squirrels
.
Not
to
evil
,
I
think
.
But
there
is
much
to
read
in
that
book
,
and
I
cannot
claim
to
have
seen
more
than
a
page
or
two
.
Frodo   B-PER
actually
laughed
.
The
other
hobbits
agreed
hopefully
that
it
did
not
,
but
they
all
remained
full
of
suspicion
.
hai
!
Excellent
!
The
stair
was
dark
,
but
on
the
roof
top
the
glare
of
the
Mountain
could
still
be
seen
,
though
it
was
dying
down
now
to
a
sullen
red
.
We
are
coming
to
reaches
of
the
River
that
I
do
not
know
well
:
for
I
have
never
journeyed
by
water
in
these
parts
before
,
not
between
here
and
the
rapids
of
Sarn    B-LOC   
Gebir   I-LOC
.
That
would
not
be
easy
,
even
if
we
were
all
Men
,
said
Boromir B-PER
.
So
the
Company
went
on
their
long
way
,
down
the
wide
hurrying
waters
,
borne
ever
southwards
.
I
ll
look
in
again
later
.
Then
the
watch
upon
the
walls
of
Mordor  B-LOC
slept
,
and
dark
things
crept
back
to
Gorgoroth   B-LOC   
.
Pippin  B-PER
declared
that
Frodo   B-PER
was
looking
twice
the
hobbit
that
he
had
been
.
But
you
won
t
send
him
off
alone
surely
,
Master
?
But
not
the
nice
hobbit
?
Pippin  B-PER
,
said
Sam B-PER
.
Orc
gear
s
no
good
,
said
Sam B-PER
,
waving
his
arms
.
I
will
shorten
the
stirrups
up
to
the
saddle
skins
,
and
you
must
sit
as
tight
as
you
can
.
I
wonder
what
became
of
it
.
How
long
have
you
known
this
?
I
cannot
answer
that
now
,
said
Gandalf B-PER
.
Just
as
nice
a
little
stair
for
that
slinking
Gollum  B-PER
as
we
could
leave
.
Merry   B-PER
slept
until
he
was
roused
by
Legolas B-PER
and
Gimli   B-PER
.
Come
,
Mr.
Frodo   B-PER
,
said
Sam
.
said
the
Elf
in
a
hissing
whisper
,
and
cast
on
to
the
flet
the
rope
ladder
rolled
up
.
I
wish
it
had
never
,
never
,
been
found
.
Wandering
aimlessly
at
first
in
the
wood
,
Frodo   B-PER
found
that
his
feet
were
leading
him
up
towards
the
slopes
of
the
hill
.
There
were
some
that
shook
their
heads
and
thought
this
was
too
much
of
a
good
thing
;
it
seemed
unfair
that
anyone
should
possess
(
apparently
)
perpetual
youth
as
well
as
(
reputedly
)
inexhaustible
wealth
.
A
little
way
off
he
heard
a
harsh
laugh
and
the
tread
of
many
feet
on
the
ground
below
.
Wolf
!
It
is
close
to
the
Road
.
said
Gandalf B-PER
,
shaking
his
head
.
But
soon
Pippin  B-PER
saw
that
all
was
in
fact
well
ordered
:
the
wains
were
moving
in
three
lines
,
one
swifter
drawn
by
horses
;
another
slower
,
great
waggons
with
fair
housings
of
many
colours
,
drawn
by
oxen
;
and
along
the
west
rim
of
the
road
many
smaller
carts
hauled
by
trudging
men
.
Yet
,
Master
Peregrin    B-PER
,
we
have
this
honour
:
ever
we
bear
the
brunt
of
the
chief
hatred
of
the
Dark    B-PER
Lord    I-PER
,
for
that
hatred
comes
down
out
of
the
depths
of
time
and
over
the
deeps
of
the
Sea
.
A
score
or
more
.
Yet
that
was
now
a
day
ago
.
s
had
passed
,
and
was
looking
straight
at
Bilbo   B-PER
when
he
suddenly
reappeared
.
In
that
clear
air
watchmen
on
the
walls
saw
afar
a
new
sight
of
fear
,
and
their
last
hope
left
them
.
said
Gimli   B-PER
.
It
is
rather
a
strange
and
sad
story
,
he
went
on
after
a
pause
.
Great
beasts
drew
it
,
Orcs
surrounded
it
,
and
behind
walked
mountain
trolls
to
wield
it
.
Often
blocked
or
destroyed
by
the
tumults
of
the
Mountain
s
furnaces
,
always
that
road
was
repaired
and
cleaned
again
by
the
labours
of
countless
orcs
.
You
were
very
fond
of
Bilbo   B-PER
were
you
not
?
’
Sam B-PER
muttered
something
inaudible
.
It
will
go
behind
the
hills
soon
,
yess
.
But
you
d
best
ask
Barliman    B-PER
.
He
told
me
that
his
business
with
you
had
gone
well
,
and
that
you
would
be
starting
for
Rivendell   B-LOC   
in
the
last
week
of
September
.
I
wonder
what
he
will
say
?
Is
that
so
?
Before
them
the
mountains
frowned
,
but
their
path
lay
in
a
deep
trough
of
land
and
they
could
see
only
the
higher
shoulders
and
the
far
eastward
peaks
.
Many
of
the
trees
seemed
asleep
,
or
as
unaware
of
him
as
of
any
other
creature
that
merely
passed
by
;
but
some
quivered
,
and
some
raised
up
their
branches
above
his
head
as
he
approached
.
He
sheathed
his
sword
.
It
will
be
quicker
so
.
And
I
hope
he
s
up
to
no
tricks
.
Now
I
see
your
mind
.
Gimli   B-PER
started
and
then
stood
still
as
stone
,
staring
,
while
the
old
man
sprang
up
the
rough
steps
as
nimbly
as
a
goat
.
But
I
don’t
think
you
need
go
alone
.
Sleepy
heads
,
yes
,
sleepy
heads
!
In
a
little
while
they
came
to
the
point
on
the
East
Road
where
they
had
taken
leave
of
Bombadil    B-PER    
;
and
they
hoped
and
half
expected
to
see
him
standing
there
to
greet
them
as
they
went
by
.
Well
,
I
have
rather
a
rascally
look
,
have
I
not
?
I
was
not
sure
of
it
myself
when
I
was
last
here
;
but
the
time
has
come
to
speak
.
Steep
as
a
stair
,
it
looped
backwards
and
forwards
as
it
climbed
.
What
of
the
Three
Rings
of
the
Elves
?
I
used
to
think
that
they
were
things
the
wonderful
folk
of
the
stories
went
out
and
looked
for
,
because
they
wanted
them
,
because
they
were
exciting
and
life
was
a
bit
dull
,
a
kind
of
a
sport
,
as
you
might
say
.
There
he
stood
,
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
and
the
wind
in
his
hair
,
and
looked
down
upon
the
three
hobbits
,
that
had
been
laid
on
their
backs
upon
the
grass
at
the
west
side
of
the
mound
.
Whether
because
of
some
special
keenness
of
sight
,
or
because
of
some
other
sense
,
the
horse
lifted
and
sprang
lightly
over
them
;
but
its
rider
did
not
see
them
,
lying
covered
in
their
elven
cloaks
,
too
crushed
for
the
moment
,
and
too
afraid
to
move
.
I
will
sleep
now
,
’
he
said
;
and
the
Elf
led
him
to
a
bower
beside
Pippin  B-PER
,
and
he
threw
himself
upon
a
bed
and
fell
at
once
into
a
dreamless
slumber
.
At
that
Bilbo   B-PER
opened
an
eye
,
almost
as
if
he
had
heard
.
Must
get
up
,
yes
they
must
!
It
won
t
sound
too
pretty
to
say
you
ve
caught
the
kitten
and
let
the
cat
escape
.
He
soon
found
that
the
thicket
was
closer
and
more
tangled
than
it
had
appeared
.
Later
that
day
the
hobbits
held
a
meeting
of
their
own
in
Bilbo’s B-PER
room
.
The
Sackville   B-PER
Bagginses   I-PER
were
rather
offensive
.
The
morning
is
wearing
away
.
Then
swift
as
a
runner
over
firm
sand
he
shot
away
,
and
quickly
overtaking
the
toiling
men
,
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
he
passed
them
,
and
sped
into
the
distance
,
and
vanished
round
the
rocky
turn
.
Even
reckoned
as
a
lord
and
captain
Saruman B-PER
has
grown
very
strong
.
The
land
had
changed
.
Yet
,
maybe
,
he
would
not
have
done
so
,
and
the
journey
of
Boromir B-PER
was
doomed
.
Frodo   B-PER
,
Mr.
Frodo   B-PER
!
Suddenly
Frodo   B-PER
laughed
:
from
the
covered
basket
he
held
,
the
scent
of
mushrooms
was
rising
.
But
few
marked
what
Isildur B-PER
did
.
Then
he
let
sound
a
great
concourse
of
trumpets
taken
from
the
enemy
;
and
the
Shadow
Host
withdrew
to
the
shore
.
And
the
Dwarf
,
hearing
the
names
given
in
his
own
ancient
tongue
,
looked
up
and
met
her
eyes
;
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
looked
suddenly
into
the
heart
of
an
enemy
and
saw
there
love
and
understanding
.
Not
far
down
the
bank
Strider B-PER
pointed
out
a
stone
in
the
grass
.
Twice
.
What
shall
we
wear
?
None
would
withstand
them
.
For
Radagast    B-PER
knew
no
reason
why
he
should
not
do
as
I
asked
;
and
he
rode
away
towards
Mirkwood    B-LOC
where
he
had
many
friends
of
old
.
In
those
days
the
Companions
of
the
Ring
dwelt
together
in
a
fair
house
with
Gandalf B-PER
,
and
they
went
to
and
fro
as
they
wished
.
I
am
Mr.
Underhill   B-PER
,
if
any
name
must
be
given
.
And
why
should
he
want
such
slaves
?
Man
!
Dangerous
,
and
probably
useless
;
but
it
must
be
done
.
’
And
to
Frodo   B-PER
she
said
:
Farewell
,
Elf
friend
,
it
was
a
merry
meeting
!
Not
much
use
is
it
,
Sam B-PER
?   
I
came
to
Buckland    B-LOC
and
found
it
in
uproar
,
as
busy
as
a
hive
of
ants
that
has
been
stirred
with
a
stick
.
There
were
the
prints
of
orc
feet
in
the
earth
.
Then
the
Nine    B-PER
Riders  I-PER
issued
forth
from
the
gates
of
horror
,
and
we
could
not
withstand
them
.
spilled
and
fed
the
falling
stream
.
A
great
cloud
of
it
was
going
up
far
away
in
the
direction
of
the
Woody   B-LOC
End I-LOC
.
They
had
ridden
for
some
five
hours
and
were
far
out
upon
the
western
plain
,
yet
more
than
half
their
journey
lay
still
before
them
.
Before
he
could
conceal
it
,
they
saw
through
the
mask
the
anguish
of
a
mind
in
doubt
,
loathing
to
stay
and
dreading
to
leave
its
refuge
.
I
do
not
know
for
what
reason
the
Enemy
is
pursuing
you
,
answered
Gildor  B-PER
;
but
I
perceive
that
he
is
strange
indeed
though
that
seems
to
me
.
Got
you
,
Gorbag  B-PER
!
These
Rings
have
a
way
of
being
found
.
The
morning
was
now
far
advanced
.
he
said
.
Your
small
fire
,
of
course
,
would
not
melt
even
ordinary
gold
.
It
is
a
sad
necessity
.
He
stepped
back
shaking
all
over
and
looked
at
the
Lady
.
If
only
they
are
in
a
hurry
and
will
let
a
couple
of
tired
soldiers
alone
and
pass
on
!
May
the
curse
of
Faramir B-PER
bite
that
Gollum  B-PER
and
bite
him
quick
!
Many
fives
of
his
small
kind
.
Now
answer
me
:
whither
would
you
go
?
A
new
hour
comes
.
Would
any
of
you
have
believed
me
till
now
?
They
saw
nothing
more
,
until
they
stumbled
over
the
body
of
Frodo   B-PER
,
lying
as
if
dead
,
face
downwards
on
the
grass
with
his
sword
beneath
him
.
At
his
side    
Pippin  B-PER
lay
dreaming
pleasantly
;
but
a
change
came
over
his
dreams
and
he
turned
and
groaned
.
s
get
their
claws
on
it
,
at
any
rate
I
have
found
a
good
home
for
this
!
Rowan   B-PER
trees
grew
about
it
,
and
in
the
midst
was
a
wide
flat
stone
.
Nice
hobbit
,
come
back
to
poor
Smeagol B-PER
.
Sam B-PER
!
But
I’m
beginning
to
think
it’s
time
we
got
a
sight
of
that
Fiery   B-LOC
Mountain    I-LOC
,
and
saw
the
end
of
the
Road
,
so
to
speak
.
I
have
no
memory
of
this
place
at
all
!
’
said
Glorfindel  B-PER
to
them
,
pouring
for
each
in
turn
a
little
liquor
from
his
silver
studded
flask
of
leather
.
Sam B-PER
!
What
is
it
all
about
?
How
far
is
there
to
go
?
The
boats
were
all
huddled
together
.
Surely
the
time
is
up
?
They
are
made
of
the
fair
tree
lebethron
,
beloved
of
the
woodwrights
of
Gondor  B-LOC
,
and
a
virtue
has
been
set
upon
them
of
finding
and
returning
.
Why
yes
!
All
the
same
,
I
am
not
sure
that
Treebeard   B-PER
is
right
:
I
fancy
he
could
do
some
mischief
still
in
a
small
mean
way
.
Gandalf B-PER
sat
down
again
and
puffed
at
his
pipe
,
as
if
lost
in
thought
.
Then
they
all
fell
silent
,
and
one
by
one
the
hobbits
dropped
off
to
sleep
.
So
it
was
that
Frodo   B-PER
saw
her
whom
few
mortals
had
yet
seen
;
Arwen
,
daughter
of
Elrond  B-PER
,
in
whom
it
was
said
that
the
likeness
of
Luthien B-PER
had
come
on
earth
again
;
and
she
was
called
Undomiel    B-PER
,
for
she
was
the
Evenstar
of
her
people
.
Out
flew
a
red
golden
dragon
not
life
size
,
but
terribly
life
like
:
fire
came
from
his
jaws
,
his
eyes
glared
down
;
there
was
a
roar
,
and
he
whizzed
three
times
over
the
heads
of
the
crowd
.
We
don't
often
see
Shire   B-LOC
folk
riding
on
the
Road
at
night
,
he
went
on
,
as
they
halted
a
moment
by
his
door
.
It
was
early
April
and
the
sky
was
now
clearing
after
heavy
rain
.
At
that
moment
the
rider
sat
up
,
and
shook
the
reins
.
In
what
far
time
and
place
did
he
come
into
the
world
,
and
when
would
he
leave
it
?
Here
the
Company
decided
to
stay
and
await
the
dawn
:
it
was
useless
to
attempt
to
move
further
by
night
.
For
a
while
out
of
politeness
the
hobbits
visited
the
Common
Room
in
the
evening
and
answered
a
good
many
questions
.
No
man
will
touch
them
I
promise
you
,
he
said
.
I
think
I
could
probably
make
some
arrangements
by
then
.
In
a
twinkling
the
table
was
laid
.
Smeagol B-PER
was
holding
a
debate
with
some
other
thought
that
used
the
same
voice
but
made
it
squeak
and
hiss
.
Leg
it
!
Well
,
here
is
the
strangest
riddle
that
we
have
yet
found
!
Must
bathe
feet
a
minute
.
That
was
a
regrettable
misunderstanding
,
long
set
right
.
It
is
but
a
trifle
that
Sauron  B-PER
fancies
,
and
an
earnest
of
your
good
will
.
Well
earned
?
Frodo   B-PER
sat
for
a
while
and
shivered
,
dreadful
fears
chasing
one
another
through
his
mind
.
No
,
said
Gandalf B-PER
.
So
wise
they
are
;
so
just
,
so
very
just
.
he
shouted
as
he
leaped
down
the
stair
from
the
Rock
with
many
men
of
Westfold    B-LOC
at
his
back
.
Pippin  B-PER
and
Sam B-PER
strapped
up
their
three
packs
and
piled
them
in
the
porch
.
No
,
not
at
the
rear
!
It
does
,
said
Frodo   B-PER
.
The
other
halted
,
and
his
voice
was
full
of
fear
and
rage
.
So
he
will
!
Darkness
came
early
to
the
silent
woods
,
and
before
the
fall
of
night
they
halted
,
weary
,
for
they
had
walked
seven
leagues
or
more
from
Henneth B-LOC
Annun   I-LOC
.
Some
suddenly
loomed
up
right
in
front
of
him
.
Before
long
,
washed
and
refreshed
,
the
hobbits
were
seated
at
the
table
,
two
on
each
side
,
while
at
either
end
sat
Gold    B-PER
berry   I-PER
and
the
Master
.
Come
,
Smeagol B-PER
!
He
is
a
valiant
man
.
Clang
.
They
came
swiftly
from
the
North
,
walking
like
wading
herons
in
their
gait
,
but
not
in
their
speed
;
for
their
legs
in
their
long
paces
beat
quicker
than
the
heron
s
wings
.
He
told
us
not
to
risk
getting
entangled
in
it
.
A
black
shadow
seemed
to
pass
like
an
arm
above
him
;
it
missed
Amon    B-LOC
Hen I-LOC
and
groped
out
west
,
and
faded
.
Why
did
it
come
to
me
?
I
think
one
of
his
spies
would
well
,
seem
fairer
and
feel
fouler
,
if
you
understand
.
In
days
to
come
,
if
my
Elven
lord
allows
,
some
of
our
folk
shall
remove
hither
;
and
when
we
come
it
shall
be
blessed
,
for
a
while
.
I
want
to
find
my
gaffer
.
’
So
do
I
,
’
said
Gandalf B-PER
.
Come
on
now
,
master
,
sing
us
something
that
we
haven’t
heard
before
!
Then
he
shut
and
locked
the
door
.
The
landlord
jumped
with
surprise
.
The
trail
led
them
north
along
the
top
of
the
escarpment
,
and
at
length
they
came
to
a
deep
cleft
carved
in
the
rock
by
a
stream
that
splashed
noisily
down
.
When
they
had
finished
they
stood
up
.
They
stared
at
him
in
alarm
for
a
moment
before
he
gasped
:
I
have
seen
them
,
Frodo   B-PER
!
It
is
not
a
very
broad
belt
I
should
have
said
no
more
than
a
mile
at
the
widest
and
we
ought
to
have
been
through
it
by
now
.
Frodo
went
in
once
,
long
ago
.
Behind
that
there
was
something
else
at
work
,
beyond
any
design
of
the
Ring
maker
.
You
are
not
alone
.
What
will
become
of
him
?
’
I
do
indeed
,
’
answered
Strider B-PER
.
’
Well
yes
and
no
.
I
thought
we
should
be
off
today
.
Be
wary
still
!
Ride
now
,
ride
!
My
heart
would
be
glad
if
I
were
beneath
the
eaves
of
that
wood
,
and
it
were
springtime
!
So
they
called
him
Gollum  B-PER
,
and
cursed
him
,
and
told
him
to
go
far
away
;
and
his
grandmother
,
desiring
peace
,
expelled
him
from
the
family
and
turned
him
out
of
her
hole
.
’
said
Frodo   B-PER
.
He
is
his
own
master
.
No
,
not
altogether
wicked
,
said
Frodo
.
It
would
possess
him
.
They
spoke
of
many
things
,
old
and
new
,
and
Frodo   B-PER
ques
tioned
Gildor  B-PER  
much
about
happenings
in
the
wide
world
outside
the
Shire   B-LOC
.
Now
the
time
was
anxious
,
and
the
host
was
in
peril
.
He
must
have
put
the
Ring
on
.
What
do
you
wish
?
Then
who
would
you
take
up
with
?
Will
you
come
and
see
it
?
That
came
in
his
tale
,
long
long
ago
.
And
why
do
men
fight
here
in
the
Hallows B-LOC
when
there
is
war
enough
before
the
Gate
?
The
Forest  B-LOC
of  I-LOC
Dr  I-LOC
adan
he
gives
to
Ghan    B-PER
buri    I-PER
ghan    I-PER
and
to
his
folk
,
to
be
their
own
for
ever
;
and
hereafter
let
no
man
enter
it
without
their
leave
!
Time
!
But
he
was
gone
.
Some
were
brightly
painted
,
and
shone
with
silver
and
gold
and
green
,
but
most
were
either
white
or
grey
.
He
was
interested
,
however
,
to
hear
that
Dain    B-PER
was
still
King
under
the
Mountain
,
and
was
now
old
(
having
passed
his
two
hundred
and
fiftieth
year
)
,
venerable
,
and
fabulously
rich
.
But
if
you
ask
me
,
Elrond  B-PER
will
send
out
a
fair
number
,
when
the
reports
come
in
.
I
do
not
foretell
,
for
all
foretelling
is
now
vain
:
on
the
one
hand
lies
darkness
,
and
on
the
other
only
hope
.
I
sit
beside
the
fire
and
think
of
people
long
ago
,
and
people
who
will
see
a
world
that
I
shall
never
know
.
’
But
just
as
he
thought
,
his
dinner
was
caught
,
He
found
his
hands
had
hold
of
naught
.
And
now
from
beyond
the
bridge
end
came
answering
cries
.
Come
and
look
and
tell
me
what
I
can
see
.
he
said
.
But
it
would
be
too
tiring
to
repeat
it
all
.
The
hobbits
seated
themselves
beside
him
,
one
on
either
side
.
The
great
doors
of
the
Black   B-LOC
Gate    I-LOC
swung
back
wide
.
And
he
collected
a
lot
,
I
can
tell
you
,
before
he
was
finally
caught
.
We
shall
all
be
scattered
and
lost
,
’
groaned
Aragorn B-PER
.
I
hope
,
if
I
do
go
to
sleep
in
this
bird
loft
,
that
I
shan’t
roll
off
,
’
he
said
.
They
allowed
themselves
half
a
piece
of
the
Elvish
waybread
each
.
There
is
no
sound
for
miles
about
us
,
and
your
voices
seem
to
make
the
ground
echo
.
One
can
meet
them
sometimes
in
the
Woody   B-LOC
End I-LOC
.
To
the
left
stood
a
great
mound
,
covered
with
a
sward
of
grass
as
green
as
Spring
time
in
the
Elder
Days
.
We
may
not
have
a
chance
of
filling
our
skins
and
bottles
till
we
come
down
into
Dimrill B-LOC
Dale    I-LOC
.
Indeed
I
may
now
reveal
that
it
was
partly
in
hope
to
find
that
ring
that
Balin   B-PER
went
away
.
They
spoke
little
as
they
trudged
along
.
Not
wholly
so
,
yet
it
did
not
achieve
its
end
.
Come
on
!
Strider B-PER
!
People
stared
much
as
he
passed
.
Come
,
Precious
is
waiting
!
I
was
told
to
find
you
before
Midsummer
,
and
that
is
now
here
.
Might
I
ask
your
names
,
sirs
?
I
guess
that
he
was
attacked
on
this
hill
top
,
but
with
what
result
I
cannot
tell
.
And
with
that
he
lifted
high
his
sword
and
flames
ran
down
the
blade
.
The
hobbits
wandered
here
and
there
visiting
again
the
places
that
they
had
passed
before
;
and
Sam B-PER
hoped
always
in
some
shadow
of
the
woods
or
secret
glade
to
catch
,
maybe
,
a
glimpse
of
the
great
Oliphaunt   
.
It
was
a
path
made
by
strong
arms
and
heavy
feet
.
No
,
I
can
t
give
no
message
.
Boats
may
make
your
journey
less
toilsome
for
a
while
.
Just
this
,
my
dear
old
Frodo   B-PER
:
you
are
miserable
,
because
you
don’t
know
how
to
say
good
bye
.
His
upturned
hornlike
tusks
were
bound
with
bands
of
gold
and
dripped
with
blood
.
The
travellers
passed
within
,
and
the
gates
shut
behind
them
.
Small
bands
of
weary
and
often
wounded
men
came
first
with
little
order
;
some
were
running
wildly
as
if
pursued
.
What
other
fairer
way
would
you
desire
?
chuckled
Merry   B-PER
as
he
rolled
himself
in
his
blanket
.
Time
is
pressing
,
said
the
Rider   B-PER
,
not
heeding
Aragorn B-PER
.
Yes
,
I
think
that
would
be
so
.
He
shuddered
and
said
no
more
,
leaving
Merry   B-PER
to
tell
of
those
last
horrible
moments
:
the
pawing
hands
,
the
hot
breath
,
and
the
dreadful
strength
of
Grishnakh's B-PER
hairy
arms
.
All
the
top
of
your
hill
is
full
of
tunnels
packed
with
chests
of
gold
and
silver
,
and
jools
,
by
what
I’ve
heard
.
And
yet
again
Ents
are
more
like
Men
,
more
changeable
than
Elves
are
,
and
quicker
at
taking
the
colour
of
the
outside
,
you
might
say
.
No
,
said
Merry   B-PER
.
As
the
dark
drew
on
I
knew
that
haste
was
needed
,
so
I
rode
thence
with
three
others
that
could
also
be
horsed
.
Even
the
Elves
do
likewise
at
need
,
and
blindfolded
we
crossed
the
borders
of
fair
Lothlorien  B-LOC
.
The
Riders
were
too
swift
to
overtake
,
and
too
many
to
oppose
.
I
fancy
now
that
she
could
do
some
wonderful
things
,
if
she
had
a
mind
.
It
has
passed
on
.
As
the
stars
above
the
mists
of
the
Northern
lands
was
her
loveliness
,
and
in
her
face
was
a
shining
light
.
They
rode
down
the
bank
and
looked
up
and
down
.
Dotard
!
Worst
is
a
bad
word
,
I
said
to
him
,
and
I
hope
you
do
not
live
to
see
it
.
The
Sackville   B-PER
Bagginses   I-PER
scowled
,
and
wondered
what
was
meant
by
coming
into
his
inheritance’
.
The
terrors
of
the
land
beyond
,
and
the
deed
to
be
done
there
,
seemed
remote
,
too
far
off
yet
to
trouble
him
.
Frodo   B-PER
was
the
wisest
person
in
the
world
(
with
the
possible
exception
of
Old
Mr.
Bilbo   B-PER
and
of
Gandalf B-PER
)
.
I
was
not
sent
to
beg
any
boon
,
but
to
seek
only
the
meaning
of
a
riddle
,
answered
Boromir B-PER
proudly
.
You
are
kindly
hosts
!
Leave
your
barrow
empty
!
The
Lord
drives
his
son
too
hard
,
and
now
he
must
do
the
duty
of
two
,
for
himself
and
for
the
one
that
will
not
return
.
The
late
afternoon
was
bright
and
peaceful
.
I
do
not
know
.
he
cried
.
I
never
really
expected
to
find
any
pipe
weed
on
the
journey
,
when
my
own
ran
out
.
Hullo
,
Sam B-PER
!
At
that
moment
some
dozen
Orcs
that
had
lain
motionless
among
the
slain
leaped
to
their
feet
,
and
came
silently
and
swiftly
behind
.
But
we
call
it
lembas
or
waybread
,
and
it
is
more
strengthening
than
any
food
made
by
Men
,
and
it
is
more
pleasant
than
cram
,
by
all
accounts
.
He
did
not
speak
so
that
I
could
hear
words
.
It
could
be
beaten
like
copper
,
and
polished
like
glass
;
and
the
Dwarves
could
make
of
it
a
metal
,
light
and
yet
harder
than
tempered
steel
.
That
night
they
camped
on
a
stony
shelf
with
a
rock
wall
behind
them
,
in
which
there
was
a
shallow
cave
,
a
mere
scoop
in
the
cliff
.
Black
drops
dripped
from
the
blade
and
smoked
on
the
floor
.
Maybe
thou
shalt
find
Valimar B-LOC
.
That
much
I
perceived
clearly
in
his
mind
.
They
did
not
talk
,
but
kept
glancing
back
,
and
from
side
to
side
.
’
We
can
cut
straighter
than
the
road
anyway
,
’
answered
Frodo   B-PER
.
You
ll
see
,
Mr.
Frodo   B-PER
.
Go
after
those
two
young
hobbits
,
and
guard
them
at
the
least
,
even
if
you
cannot
find
Frodo   B-PER
.
He
was
very
quiet
to
begin
with
,
but
his
fame
began
to
grow
.
Aye
,
you
do
indeed
,
said
Gimli   B-PER
,
looking
them
up
and
down
over
the
top
of
his
cup
.
It
is
no
good
trying
to
escape
you
.
Beneath
the
stars
of
Ever
eve
in
Eldamar B-LOC
it
shone
,
In
Eldamar B-LOC
beside
the
walls
of
Elven
Tirion  B-LOC
.
It
was
answered
;
and
to  
the
dismay
of
Frodo   B-PER
and
his
friends
out
from
the
trees
and
rocks
away
on
the
left
four
other
Riders  B-ORG
came
flying
.
Frodo   B-PER
came
in
soon
afterwards
,
and
found
him
sitting
in
the
dark
,
deep
in
thought
.
Away
in
the
distance
eastward
they
could
now
see
a
line
of
hills
.
Same
one
,
I
reckon
.
There's
a
tidy
bit
of
money
tucked
away
up
there
,
I
hear
tell
,
said
a
stranger
,
a
visitor
on
business
from
Michel  B-LOC
Delving I-LOC
in
the
Westfarthing    B-LOC
.
’
Yes 
,
long
and
weary
,
’
said
Gandalf	B-PER
,
but
not
without
profit
.
There
are
columns
of
white
and
saffron
and
dawn
rose
,
Legolas	B-PER
,
fluted
and
twisted
into
dreamlike
forms
;
they
spring
up
from
many
coloured
floors
to
meet
the
glistening
pendants
of
the
roof
:
wings
,
ropes
,
curtains
fine
as
frozen
clouds
;
spears
,
banners
,
pinnacles
of
suspended
palaces
!
Still
lakes
mirror
them
:
a
glimmering
world
looks
up
from
dark
pools
covered
with
clear
glass
;
cities
.
He
stretched
himself
upon
the
ground
with
his
ear
pressed
against
the
turf
.
His
sword
was
long
,
his
lance
was
keen
,
his
shining
helm
afar
was
seen
;
the
countless
stars
of
heaven's
field
were
mirrored
in
his
silver
shield
.
Yes
,
we
certainly
must
decide
what
to
do
at
once
,
answered
Strider	B-PER
,
looking
up
and
considering
the
time
and
the
weather
.
Regiments
of
black
crows
are
flying
over
all
the
land
between
the
Mountains	B-LOC
and
the
Greyflood	B-LOC
,
he
said
,
and
they
have
passed
over
Hollin	B-LOC
.
Then
at
last
his
gaze
was
held
:
wall
upon
wall
,
battlement
upon
battlement
,
black
,
immeasurably
strong
,
mountain
of
iron
,
gate
of
steel
,
tower
of
adamant
,
he
saw
it
:
Baraddr	B-LOC
,
Fortress	B-LOC
of	B-LOC
Sauron	B-LOC
.
Smagol	B-LOC
is
not
pleased
.
The
Lord	B-PER
is
out
of
his
mind
,
I
think
.
You
must
make
up
your
mind
.
The
victor
would
emerge
stronger
than
either
,
and
free
from
doubt
,
said
Gandalf	B-PER
.
Let
us
gird
ourselves
and
weep
no
more
!
Come
!
We
have
a
long
road
,
and
much
to
do
.
You
will
be
glad
to
have
them
back
.
Have
hope
!
said
Boromir	B-PER
.
Merry	B-PER
and
Pippin	B-PER
climbed
the
gate
,
and
the
hobbits
fled
.
But
not
here
or
now
.
(
Otho	B-PER
had
died
some
years
before
,
at
the
ripe
but
disappointed
age
of
102
.
My
lad
,
said
Troll
,
this
bone
I
stole
.
As
they
rode
forward
the
day
was
overcast
.
Now
for
the
last
race
!
said
Gandalf	B-PER
.
And
listen
,
Gandalf	B-PER
,
my
old
friend
and
helper
!
he
said
,
coming
near
and
speaking
now
in
a
softer
voice
.
The
Dwarves
have
a
name
which
they
do
not
tell
.
’
He
said
it
?
And
who
was
he
?
’
asked
Frodo	B-PER
eagerly
.
Not
for
long
now
,
said
Gandalf	B-PER
.
He
took
his
own
tea
with
Pippin	B-PER
and
Sam	B-PER
Gamgee	I-PER
in
the
kitchen
.
Hope
is
not
victory
.
’
Indeed
it
would
take
away
the
only
point
I
ever
saw
in
the
affair
,
’
said
Gandalf	B-PER
.
At
their
first
halt
they
looked
back
,
and
they
could
dimly
perceive
the
roofs
of
the
forest
they
had
left
behind
lying
like
a
vast
dense
shadow
,
a
darker
night
under
the
dark
blank
sky
.
What's
to
be
done
?
Have
those
eyes
come
back
?
No
,
not
to
be
seen
,
said
Frodo	B-PER
.
I
ll
just
plod
along
after
you
.
Farmer
Cotton	B-PER
looked
at
him
slowly
.
The
hobbits
looked
anxiously
at
the
distant
hills
.
Then
for
a
while
hope
left
me
,
and
I
did
not
wait
to
gather
news
,
or
I
might
have
been
comforted
;
but
I
rode
on
the
trail
of
the
Riders
.
It
was
dark
save
for
an
occasional
torch
flaring
at
a
turn
,
or
beside
some
opening
that
led
into
the
higher
levels
of
the
Tower	B-LOC
.
They
will
drive
these
wretches
to
some
evil
work
:
Ferny	B-PER
,
and
some
of
the
strangers
,
and
,
maybe
,
the
gatekeeper
too
.
We
come
to
teach
them
another
lesson
.
They
were
only
half
way
across
the
flat
,
when
suddenly
there
was
a
noise
of
horses
galloping
.
It
is
mine
,
I
tell
you
.
Hobbits
?
said
Théoden	B-PER
.
Go
on
now
!
But
take
care
of
yourself
,
and
come
straight
back
as
soon
as
you
have
settled
the
ruffians
!
When
Sam	B-PER
got
back
he
found
the
whole
village
roused
.
Time
flows
on
to
a
spring
of
little
hope
.
None
at
all
,
’
he
said
.
Frodo	B-PER
peering
forward
saw
in
the
distance
two
great
rocks
approaching
:
like
great
pinnacles
or
pillars
of
stone
they
seemed
.
But
as
they
went
the
most
easterly
of
the
roads
followed
them
,
until
it
ran
off
,
hugging
the
skirts
of
the
mountains
,
away
into
a
wall
of
black
shadow
far
ahead
.
The
two
guards
were
not
in
view
:
they
were
up
on
the
hill
,
perhaps
,
or
hidden
in
the
bracken
.
It
was
a
misty
,
moisty
morning
when
we
climbed
down
and
looked
round
again
,
and
nobody
was
about
.
And
now
I
think
I’ll
be
getting
to
bed
.
Great
deed
was
the
riding
of
the
Paths	B-LOC
of	I-LOC
the	I-LOC
Dead	I-LOC
,
and
great
it
shall
remain
,
though
none
be
left
in
Gondor	B-LOC
to
sing
of
it
in
the
days
that
are
to
come
.
The
feast
was
merry
and
the
food
all
that
his
hunger
could
desire
.
But
something
held
him
back
.
I
hope
that
you
ll
not
take
it
amiss
.
If
that
isn't
the
very
tree
you
hid
behind
when
the
Black	B-PER
Rider	I-PER
first
showed
up
,
Mr.
Frodo	B-PER
!
said
Sam	B-PER
pointing
to
the
left
.
The
worthies
of
Bree	B-LOC
will
be
dis
cussing
it
a
hundred
years
hence
.
Nay
,
there
was
no
change
of
counsel
,
said
the
Lady
Galadriel	B-PER
speaking
for
the
first
time
.
He
was
covered
with
green
slime
.
Sméagol	B-PER
will
swear
never
,
never
,
to
let
Him
have
it
.
It
is
not
my
will
,
he
said
,
to
put
aside
my
sword
or
to
deliver
And
ril
to
the
hand
of
any
other
man
.
He
felt
that
black
shapes
were
advancing
to
smother
him
;
but
when
he
sat
up
he
saw
nothing
but
the
back
of
Strider	B-PER
sitting
hunched
up
,
smoking
his
pipe
,
and
watching
.
This
is
Sting
.
It
was
not
bird
or
beast
,
said
Frodo	B-PER
.
They
have
no
need
to
ride
to
war
;
war
already
marches
on
their
own
lands
.
Then
we
are
all
men
here
.
Now
tell
me
all
about
it
!
I
guess
that
you
have
been
having
adventures
,
which
was
not
quite
fair
without
me
.
He
searched
the
wound
on
Frodo's	B-PER
shoulder
with
his
fingers
,
and
his
face
grew
graver
,
as
if
what
he
learned
disquieted
him
.
Frar	B-PER
and
Loni	B-PER
and
Nali	B-PER
fell
there
.
All
that
Frodo	B-PER
and
Sam	B-PER
knew
of
this
last
mile
of
the
road
they
learned
from
guessing
in
the
dark
.
I
am
going
to
have
a
long
talk
with
Bombadil	B-PER
:
such
a
talk
as
I
have
not
had
in
all
my
time
.
What
had
come
over
them
?
Why
had
they
dashed
off
like
that
,
taking
no
notice
of
old
Strider	B-PER
?
They
had
run
a
long
way
shouting
he
could
not
remember
how
far
or
how
long
;
and
then
suddenly
they
had
crashed
right
into
a
group
of
Orcs
:
they
were
standing
listening
,
and
they
did
not
appear
to
see
Merry	B-PER
and
Pippin	B-PER
until
they
were
almost
in
their
arms
.
It
is
wretched
for
us
all
,
but
it
is
no
use
your
trying
to
keep
me
.
Every
now
and
again
they
caught
,
among
many
a
_derry
dol_
and
a
_merry
dol_
and
a
_ring
a
ding
dillo_
the
repeated
words
:
Old
Tom	B-PER
Bombadil	I-PER
is
a
merry
fellow
;
Bright
blue
his
jacket
is
,
and
his
boots
are
yellow
.
Fly
,
if
you
value
your
foul
skin
!
I
will
shrivel
you
from
tail
to
snout
,
if
you
come
within
this
ring
.
Frodo	B-PER
!
Mr.
Frodo	B-PER
,
my
dear
!
cried
Sam	B-PER
,
tears
almost
blinding
him
.
Tell
us
of
Gil-galad	B-LOC
,
said
Merry	B-PER
suddenly
,
when
he
paused
at
the
end
of
a
story
of
the
Elf	B-LOC
Kingdoms	I-LOC
.
Dangerous
indeed
,
but
not
to
all
,
said
Aragorn	B-PER
.
When
Frodo	B-PER
was
asleep
Sam	B-PER
bent
over
him
and
listened
to
his
breathing
and
scanned
his
face
.
And
those
that
watched
felt
that
some
great
struggle
was
going
on
.
I
will
send
out
messages
,
such
as
I
can
contrive
,
to
those
whom
I
know
in
the
wide
world
;
but
so
perilous
are
the
lands
now
become
that
some
may
well
mis
carry
,
or
come
no
quicker
than
you
yourself
.
Ahead
there
loomed
now
against
the
dusky
sky
the
bleak
and
treeless
backs
of
the
hills
.
We
are
all
friends
here
.
Both
father
and
son
were
on
very
friendly
terms
with
Bilbo	B-PER
and
Frodo	B-PER
.
The
trees
were
the
worst
loss
and
damage
,
for
at
Sharkey's	B-PER
bidding
they
had
been
cut
down
recklessly
far
and
wide
over
the
Shire	B-LOC
;
and
Sam	B-PER
grieved
over
this
more
than
anything
else
.
He
thrust
and
pushed
at
the
block
,
and
he
threw
himself
against
it
,
but
it
did
not
yield
.
Are
you
going
any
further
?
Yes
,
I
am
.
What
?
_Me_
take
the
Ring
from
_him_
?
The
Council	B-ORG
gave
it
to
him
.
The
drink
in
their
drinking
bowls
seemed
to
be
clear
cold
water
,
yet
it
went
to
their
hearts
like
wine
and
set
free
their
voices
.
Shadows
rose
behind
and
reached
out
long
arms
from
the
East
.
Then
I
was
weary
,
very
weary
;
and
I
walked
long
in
dark
thought
.
Frodo	B-PER
coming
behind
grabbed
his
leg
and
threw
him
.
Overcome
with
weakness
he
wept
.
He's
over
there
,
he
cackled
.
O
yes
indeed
there
is
.
Is
that
enough
for
you
?
The
Bree	B-LOC
folk
used
to
be
fair
spoken
to
travellers
,
or
so
I
had
heard
.
There
is
a
dry
fir
wood
just
ahead
,
if
I
remember
rightly
.
Fire
shall
devour
the
high
seat
.
Then
he
and
Frodo	B-PER
went
off
with
Farmer
Cotton	B-PER
.
Whither
do
you
run
,
Master
Peregrin	B-PER
?
he
cried
.
I
think
you
look
fine
,
Sam	B-PER
,
she
said
.
I
can
only
suppose
that
he
had
seen
Gandalf	B-PER
or
had
some
news
of
him
,
but
would
not
say
anything
in
a
hurry
.
He
straddled
one
of
these
,
and
paddled
his
hot
feet
in
the
cool
brown
water
;
and
there
he
too
suddenly
fell
asleep
with
his
back
against
the
tree
.
Of
course
he’s
had
a
bit
of
schooling
,
so
to
speak
we
all
have
since
we
left
home
,
or
he’d
be
so
terrified
he’d
just
fling
the
Ring
in
the
River
and
bolt
.
I
have
been
so
taken
up
with
the
thoughts
of
leaving
Bag	B-LOC
End	I-LOC
,
and
of
saying
farewell
,
that
I
have
never
even
considered
the
direction
,
said
Frodo	B-PER
.
I
told
Bilbo	B-PER
often
that
such
rings
were
better
left
unused
;
but
he
resented
it
,
and
soon
got
angry
.
I
know
we
are
going
to
take
a
very
long
road
,
into
darkness
;
but
I
know
I
can't
turn
back
.
Thither
,
eastward
,
unwilling
his
eye
was
drawn
.
But
he's
got
you
,
you
nassty
filthy
little
sneak
!
He
spat
on
Sam's	B-PER
neck
.
Sam	B-PER
stepped
back
and
braced
his
feet
against
a
stump
a
yard
or
two
from
the
edge
.
Every
now
and
again
a
tiny
red
gleam
far
away
flickered
upwards
on
the
rim
of
earth
and
sky
.
A
few
miles
to
the
north
east
the
foothills
of
the
Ashen	B-LOC
Mountains	I-LOC
stood
like
sombre
grey
ghosts
,
behind
which
the
misty
northern
heights
rose
like
a
line
of
distant
cloud
hardly
darker
than
the
lowering
sky
.
From
inside
the
hood
came
a
noise
as
of
someone
sniffing
to
catch
an
elusive
scent
;
the
head
turned
from
side
to
side
of
the
road
.
Curse
him
!
No
sooner
had
he
slipped
us
and
run
off
than
word
came
he's
wanted
alive
,
wanted
quick
.
And
they
became
our
allies
,
and
have
ever
proved
true
to
us
,
aiding
us
at
need
,
and
guarding
our
northern
marches
and
the
Gap	B-LOC
of	B-LOC
Rohan	B-LOC
.
The
Ring
is
another
:
you
are
the
Ring
bearer
.
Yet
we
are
hard
pressed
,
and
the
Sword
of
Elendil	B-PER
would
be
a
help
beyond
our
hope
if
such
a
thing
could
indeed
return
out
of
the
shadows
of
the
past
.
The
night
was
old
and
the
East
grey
when
they
rode
up
at
last
from
Deeping-coomb	B-LOC
and
came
back
to
the
Hornburg	B-LOC
.
He
used
to
tell
me
tales
like
that
,
knowing
how
I
was
always
one
for
hearing
about
Elves
.
I
think
that
the
enemy
brought
his
own
enemy
with
him
,
answered
Aragorn	B-PER
.
For
here
the
heirs
of
Valandil	B-PER
have
ever
dwelt
in
long
line
unbroken
from
father
unto
son
for
many
generations
.
Even
when
the
paddles
were
in
use
they
did
not
trust
Sam	B-PER
with
one
.
Good
evening
,
little
master
!
he
said
,
bending
down
.
Then
once
more
,
orc
fashion
,
he
leapt
aside
,
and
as
Sam	B-PER
sprang
at
him
,
using
the
heavy
bundle
as
both
shield
and
weapon
,
he
thrust
it
hard
into
his
enemy's
face
.
Yet
you
speak
the
truth
,
that
is
plain
:
the
Men	B-ORG
of	I-ORG
the	I-ORG
Mark	I-ORG
do
not
lie
,
and
therefore
they
are
not
easily
deceived
.
You
swore
a
promise
by
what
you
call
the
Precious
.
On
the
third
morning
Caradhras	B-PER
rose
before
them
,
a
mighty
peak
,
tipped
with
snow
like
silver
,
but
with
sheer
naked
sides
,
dull
red
as
if
stained
with
blood
.
They
had
no
fuel
nor
any
means
of
malting
torches
;
in
the
desperate
scramble
at
the
doors
many
things
had
been
left
behind
.
But
the
day
has
brought
strange
tidings
.
There
was
a
cold
gleam
in
it
.
Your
leechcraft
ere
long
would
have
had
me
walking
on
all
fours
like
a
beast
.
At
the
end
of
June
I
was
in
the
Shire	B-LOC
,
but
a
cloud
of
anxiety
was
on
my
mind
,
and
I
rode
to
the
southern
borders
of
the
little
land
;
for
I
had
a
foreboding
of
some
danger
,
still
hidden
from
me
but
drawing
near
.
Elrond	B-PER
and
Arwen	B-PER
rose
and
went
down
the
hall
,
and
the
company
followed
them
in
due
order
.
Travellers
scowl
at
us
,
and
countrymen
give
us
scornful
names
.
Still
we
feel
less
ill
disposed
towards
Saruman	B-PER
than
we
did
.
When
they
came
to
the
corner
they
looked
round
and
saw
that
the
path
ran
on
over
a
level
strip
under
the
face
of
a
low
cliff
overhung
with
trees
.
Anyway
,
this
is
what
happened
.
Who
comes
hither
to
disturb
the
rest
of
Balin	B-PER	
Lord
of
Moria
?
he
cried
in
a
loud
voice
.
But
say
to
Denethor	B-PER
that
even
if
Rohan	B-LOC
itself
felt
no
peril
,
still
we
would
come
to
his
aid
.
Gandalf	B-PER
was
gazing
up
,
his
arms
out
and
downwards
,
stiff
,
his
hands
clenched
.
At
first
they
could
see
nothing
.
And
begging
yours
,
Sam	B-PER
Gamgee	I-PER
,
replied
Bilbo	B-PER
.
I
don’t
know
how
to
say
it
,
but
after
last
night
I
feel
different
.
I
do
not
know
,
’
Strider	B-PER
answered
.
Frodo	B-PER		
waited
patiently
for
a
while
,
then
he
spoke
again
less
sternly
.
The
sun
was
not
,
however
,
high
enough
yet
to
shine
down
into
the
clearing
,
though
its
light
was
on
the
tree
tops
.
I
could
not
make
out
what
they
were
about
.
I
hardly
feel
that
I
have
moved
at
all
.
He
has
long
studied
it
,
seeking
the
lost
secrets
of
their
making
;
but
when
the
Rings
were
debated
in
the
Council	B-ORG
,
all
that
he
would
reveal
to
us
of
his
ring
lore
told
against
my
fears
.
Take
courage
and
look
!
There
are
fell
things
below
.
He
knows
or
guesses
something
about
it
.
The
biter
bit
,
the
hawk
under
the
eagle's
foot
,
the
spider
in
a
steel
web
!
How
long
,
I
wonder
,
has
he
been
constrained
to
come
often
to
his
glass
for
inspection
and
instruction
,
and
the
Orthanc
stone
so
bent
towards
Baraddr B-LOC
that
,
if
any
save
a
will
of
adamant
now
looks
into
it
,
it
will
bear
his
mind
and
sight
swiftly
thither
?
And
how
it
draws
one
to
itself
!
Have
I
not
felt
it
?
Even
now
my
heart
desires
to
test
my
will
upon
it
,
to
see
if
I
could
not
wrench
it
from
him
and
turn
it
where
I
would
to
look
across
the
wide
seas
of
water
and
of
time
to
Tirion	B-LOC
the	B-LOC
Fair	B-LOC
,
and
perceive
the
unimaginable
hand
and
mind
of
Fëanor	B-PER
at
their
work
,
while
both
the
White
Tree
and
the
Golden
were
in
flower
!
He
sighed
and
fell
silent
.
You
shall
sit
beside
me
,
as
long
as
I
remain
in
my
own
lands
,
and
lighten
my
heart
with
tales
.
It's
a
long
time
,
Mr.
Frodo	B-PER
,
since
I
had
a
proper
sleep
,
and
my
eyes
just
closed
down
on
their
own
.
They
came
at
last
to
a
white
bridge
,
and
crossing
found
the
great
gates
of
the
city
:
they
faced
south
west
,
set
between
the
ends
of
the
encircling
wall
that
here
overlapped
,
and
they
were
tall
and
strong
,
and
hung
with
many
lamps
.
The
roads
are
cut
.
Three
cheers
for
Captain
Frodo	B-PER
and
company
!
’
they
shouted
;
and
they
danced
round
him
.
Now
Denethor	B-PER
stood
up
and
released
the
fevered
hand
of
Faramir	B-PER
that
he
had
held
.
Find
only
news
of
the
thief
,
whether
he
still
lives
and
where
,
and
you
shall
have
great
reward
and
lasting
friendship
from
the
Lord
.
He
half
expected
to
see
Gandalf	B-PER
come
striding
up
through
the
dusk
.
Let
us
leave
them
!
They
returned
now
to
the
ruins
of
the
gate
.
Valour
in
arms
is
yours
,
and
you
win
high
honour
thereby
.
Heaving
up
again
,
wrenching
away
from
the
pain
,
she
bent
her
writhing
limbs
beneath
her
and
sprang
backwards
in
a
convulsive
leap
.
The
Sackville	B-PER
Bagginses	I-PER
were
rather
offensive
.
Sam	B-PER
turned
away
and
sighed
:
I
wish
I
was
going
back
to
Lorien	B-LOC
!
At
last
one
evening
they
came
over
the
high
moors
,
suddenly
as
to
travellers
it
always
seemed
,
to
the
brink
of
the
deep
valley
of
Rivendell	B-LOC
and
saw
far
below
the
lamps
shining
in
Elrond's	B-PER
house
.
A
part
of
his
tale
was
known
to
some
there
,
but
the
full
tale
to
none
,
and
many
eyes
were
turned't
Elrond	B-PER
in
fear
and
wonder
as
he
told
of
the
Elven
smiths
of
Eregion	B-LOC
and
their
friendship
with
Moria	B-LOC
,
and
their
eagerness
for
knowledge
,
by
which
Sauron	B-PER
ensnared
them
.
The
old
man
took
no
notice
,
but
stooped
and
sat
himself
on
a
low
flat
stone
.
There
is
a
wholesome
air
about
Hollin	B-PER
.
He
thought
as
little
as
possible
about
the
Ring
,
and
where
it
might
lead
him
in
the
end
.
The
world
is
indeed
full
of
peril
,
and
in
it
there
are
many
dark
places
;
but
still
there
is
much
that
is
fair
,
and
though
in
all
lands
love
is
now
mingled
with
grief
,
it
grows
perhaps
the
greater
.
That
is
where
my
grandsire
lives
.
And
some
that
die
deserve
life
.
Frodo	B-PER
stopped
eating
to
look
at
him
.
Pippin	B-PER
stepped
back
hastily
.
We
were
the
hunters
,
and
you
should
give
an
account
of
yourselves
to
us
first
.
We
can
fill
it
again
when
we
go
on
.
They
came
to
a
cleft
between
two
dark
crags
,
and
passing
through
found
themselves
on
the
very
edge
of
the
last
fence
of
Mordor	B-LOC
.
Turn
!
Turn
if
you
can
!
’
He
drove
his
paddle
into
the
water
,
trying
to
hold
the
boat
and
bring
it
round
.
But
still
we
fight
on
,
holding
all
the
west
shores
of
Anduin	B-LOC
;
and
those
who
shelter
behind
us
give
us
praise
,
if
ever
they
hear
our
name
:
much
praise
but
little
help
.
We
cannot
count
on
getting
anything
to
eat
between
here
and
Rivendell	B-LOC
,
except
what
we
take
with
us
;
and
we
ought
to
take
plenty
to
spare
;
for
we
may
be
delayed
,
or
forced
to
go
round
about
,
far
out
of
the
direct
way
.
There
was
a
great
draught
of
warmer
air
behind
them
,
and
before
them
the
darkness
was
cold
on
their
faces
.
She
seemed
to
be
looking
inside
me
and
asking
me
what
I
would
do
if
she
gave
me
the
chance
of
flying
back
home
to
the
Shire	B-LOC
to
a
nice
little
hole
with
with
a
bit
of
garden
of
my
own
.
Only
for
a
short
while
,
I
hope
,
he
said
.
Look
out
!
cried
Sam	B-LOC
.
Their
eyes
met
and
they
understood
.
The
next
will
be
greater
.
Sam	B-PER
will
.
And
where
were
you
off
to
in
the
cold
hard
lands
,
Mr.
Gollum	B-PER
?
he
growled
.
If
he
comes
off
alive
,
he
should
be
your
faithful
servant
for
the
rest
of
his
unhappy
days
.
At
the
top
,
as
high
as
Gandalf	B-PER
could
reach
,
was
an
arch
of
interlacing
letters
in
an
Elvish
character
.
At
the
top
of
the
bank
the
horse
halted
and
turned
about
neighing
fiercely
.
Behind
them
walked
Legolas
and
Gimli
.
Already
the
short
afternoon
was
past
,
and
a
dim
cloudy
dusk
was
closing
in
.
The
others
go
with
him
as
free
companions
,
to
help
him
on
his
way
.
Though
other
folks
besides
hobbits
ask
riddles
,
and
of
much
the
same
sort
.
I
do
not
counsel
you
to
leave
the
City
all
unmanned
.
He
was
running
on
the
green
turf
and
singing
.
We
have
no
choice
but
to
go
on
,
or
to
return
to
Rivendell	B-LOC
.
But
long
ago
he
rode
away
,
and
where
he
dwelleth
none
can
say
;
for
into
darkness
fell
his
star
in
Mordor	B-LOC
where
the
shadows
are
.
They
lived
mostly
in
Staddle	B-LOC
though
there
were
some
in
Bree	B-LOC
itself
,
especially
on
the
higher
slopes
of
the
hill
,
above
the
houses
of
the
Men
.
I
should
very
much
like
just
to
peep
at
it
again
.
He
was
the
Lord
of
Rivendell	B-LOC
and
mighty
among
both
Elves
and
Men
.
My
lord
,
said
the
Warden
,
here
is
the
Lady
Eowyn	B-PER	
of	I-PER
Rohan	I-PER
.
Your
talk
of
sniffing
riders
with
invisible
noses
has
unsettled
me
.
Yes
,
sir
!
said
Sam	B-PER
.
For
it
has
no
virtue
that
we
know
of
,
save
perhaps
to
sweeten
a
fouled
air
,
or
to
drive
away
some
passing
heaviness
.
No
fireworks
like
poor
old
Gandalf	B-PER
used
to
show
.
We
re
not
in
decent
places
.
But
it
could
not
be
found
until
last
night
.
And
rising
he
looked
then
on
Eowyn	B-PER
and
was
amazed
.
But
Tom	B-PER
now
seemed
wide
awake
and
plied
them
with
questions
.
Wicked
!
Tricksy
!
False
!
He
spat
and
stretched
out
his
long
arms
with
white
snapping
fingers
.
They
had
words
with
Harry	B-PER
at
West
gate
on
Monday
.
It
must
have
seemed
very
hasty
to
Treebeard	B-PER
,
for
Gandalf	B-PER
was
in
a
tremendous
hurry
,
and
was
already
talking
at
a
great
pace
,
before
they
passed
out
of
hearing
.
Following
the
winding
way
up
the
green
shoulders
of
the
hills
,
they
came
at
last
to
the
wide
wind
swept
walls
and
the
gates
of
Edoras	B-LOC
.
In
the
middle
there
was
a
wood
fire
blazing
,
and
upon
the
tree
pillars
torches
with
lights
of
gold
and
silver
were
burning
steadily
.
You
do
not
know
your
peril
.
At
the
top
was
a
wide
echoing
passage
.
And
you
are
the
heir
of
Bilbo	B-PER
,
the
Ring
finder
.
They
sounded
disquietingly
like
signals
of
some
sort
;
but
after
a
while
the
knocking
died
away
and
was
not
heard
again
.
Even
the
wise
cannot
see
all
ends
.
When
they
reached
the
bottom
it
was
so
chill
that
they
halted
and
got
out
cloaks
and
hoods
,
which
soon
became
bedewed
with
grey
drops
.
Did
you
ask
about
the
sniffing
?
We
didn't
discuss
it
,
said
Frodo	B-PER
with
his
mouth
full
.
They
were
going
fast
,
with
a
light
_clippety
clippely
clip
.
He
said
something
about
going
for
a
breath
of
air
.
Mind
that
!
But
you
need
ask
no
questions
.
For
otherwise
I
shall
follow
the
Company	B-ORG
.
Command
me
,
lord
!
he
cried
.
Then
be
comforted
,
said
Elrond	B-PER
.
Wait
for
me
,
Sam	B-PER
,
he
stammered
.
Yet
the
way
of
the
Ring
to
my
heart
is
by
pity
,
pity
for
weakness
and
the
desire
of
strength
to
do
good
.
Or
maybe
not
:
fish
from
the
pool
of
Henneth	B-LOC
Annun	I-LOC
may
cost
him
all
he
has
to
give
.
The
hobbits
sat
down
gladly
in
low
rush
seated
chairs
,
while
Goldberry	B-PER
busied
herself
about
the
table
;
and
their
eyes
followed
her
,
for
the
slender
grace
of
her
movement
filled
them
with
quiet
delight
.
Thanks
to
Saruman	B-PER
:
Then
is
not
Saruman	B-PER
a
traitor
?
said
Gimli	B-PER
.
They
were
on
the
top
of
a
sloping
bank
,
and
the
Road
,
now
dim
as
evening
drew
on
,
wound
away
below
them
.
And
I
don't
reckon
that
these
folk
can
do
much
more
to
help
us
,
magic
or
no
.
’
Following
his
lead
the
Company	B-ORG
passed
under
the
northern
arch
.
The
river
,
now
small
and
swift
,
was
leaping
merrily
down
to
meet
them
,
glinting
here
and
there
in
the
light
of
the
stars
,
which
were
already
shining
in
the
sky
.
The
light
of
sun
and
star
and
moon
In
shining
lamps
of
crystal
hewn
Undimmed
by
cloud
or
shade
of
night
There
shone
for
ever
fair
and
bright
.
He
did
not
get
here
till
this
morning
.
For
of
Beren
and
Luthien	B-PER
was
born
Dior	B-PER
Thingol's	I-PER
heir
;
and
of
him
Elwing	B-PER
the
White
whom
Earendil	B-PER
wedded
,
he
that
sailed
his
ship
out
of
the
mists
of
the
world
into
the
seas
of
heaven
with
the
Silmaril
upon
his
brow
.
He
began
to
take
an
interest
in
the
Shire	B-LOC
before
Mordor	B-LOC
did
.
I
want
to
see
the
wild
country
again
before
I
die
,
and
the
Mountains
;
but
he
is
still
in
love
with
the
Shire	B-LOC
,
with
woods
and
fields
and
little
rivers
.
The
forest
began
to
draw
nearer
.
Of
Numenor	B-LOC
he
spoke
,
its
glory
and
its
fall
,
and
the
return
of
the
Kings
of
Men
to
Middle	B-LOC
earth	I-LOC
out
of
the
deeps
of
the
Sea
,
borne
upon
the
wings
of
storm
.
There
they
stood
,
stooping
in
a
circle
round
the
little
dancing
and
blowing
flames
.
Maybe
there
is
some
that
want
to
know
what
has
become
of
the
gold
and
jewels
that
he
buried
in
the
hill
of
Hobbiton	B-LOC
,
as
I
hear
?
’
Frodo	B-PER
said
nothing
:
the
shrewd
guesses
of
the
farmer
were
rather
disconcerting
.
And
he
took
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
under
the
sunlit
sky
,
and
he
cared
not
that
they
stood
high
upon
the
walls
in
the
sight
of
many
.
Sounds
too
easy
at
any
rate
in
the
telling
.
But
the
Ring
was
lost
.
Right
across
the
floor
,
close
to
the
feet
of
two
huge
pillars
a
great
fissure
had
opened
.
Very
lucky
you
came
this
way
.
It
is
time
to
get
up
.
And
I
don't
remember
any
moon
,
either
new
or
old
,
in
Caras	B-LOC
Galadhon	I-LOC
:
only
stars
by
night
and
sun
by
day
.
A
star
came
out
above
the
trees
in
the
darkening
East
before
them
.
No
one
had
a
more
attentive
audience
than
old
Flam	B-PER
Gamgee	I-PER
,
commonly
known
as
the
Gaffer	B-PER
.
They
have
been
summoned
,
said
Elladan	B-PER
.
He
is
here
no
longer
,
and
we
must
now
look
after
ourselves
and
make
our
own
way
to
Rivendell	B-LOC
,
as
best
we
can
.
Loose
us
!
Loose
us
!
he
said
.
It
is
my
burden
,
and
no
one
else
can
bear
it
.
It
was
also
clear
that
Tom	B-PER
had
dealings
with
the
Elves
,
and
it
seemed
that
in
some
fashion
,
news
had
reached
him
from
Gildor	B-LOC
concerning
the
flight
of
Frodo	B-PER
.
There
are
loose
slabs
that
may
tilt
up
and
throw
you
down
into
a
pit
,
if
you
don't
take
care
.
Come
!
said
Aragorn	B-PER
.
In
the
days
of
fair
weather
we
led
Gollum	B-PER
through
the
woods
;
and
there
was
a
high
tree
standing
alone
far
from
the
others
which
he
liked
to
climb
.
Not
yet
.
They
are
all
roused
now
,
and
their
mind
is
all
on
one
thing
:
breaking
Isengard	B-LOC
.
The
mountains
were
veiled
in
deepening
dusk
,
and
the
wind
was
cold
.
Silly
old
fool
.
If
you
would
understand
them
better
,
then
I
bid
you
come
with
me
,
said
Aragorn	B-PER
;
for
that
way
I
now
shall
take
.
We
will
go
together
.
Aragorn	B-PER
halted
and
examined
the
tracks
closely
.
Men
now
hurried
out
to
them
from
the
City
;
and
soon
they
all
passed
from
sight
under
the
outer
walls
,
and
he
knew
that
they
were
entering
the
Gate
.
The
sickle
Moon
was
gleaming
dimly
among
the
leaves
.
But
now
suddenly
his
errand
returned
to
his
memory
,
and
he
ran
forward
.
Not
without
Mr.
Frodo	B-PER
.
Then
let
us
start
as
soon
as
it
is
light
tomorrow
,
if
we
can
,
said
Boromir	B-PER
.
And
the
air
is
wholesome
there
because
of
the
outlets
through
fissures
in
the
rock
far
above
.
Did
you
see
them
again
,
Mr.
Frodo	B-PER
?
asked
Sam
,
as
they
sat
,
stiff
and
chilled
,
munching
wafers
of
_lembas_
,
in
the
cold
grey
of
early
morning
.
I
have
done
my
best
.
And
if
you
make
so
much
noise
,
you
ll
wake
the
Chief's
Big
Man
.
What's
made
you
change
your
mind
about
climbing
?
I
haven't
changed
my
mind
.
He
fell
and
came
heavily
on
his
hands
,
which
sank
deep
into
sticky
ooze
,
so
that
his
face
was
brought
close
to
the
surface
of
the
dark
mere
.
The
other
three
went
on
.
Upon
the
battlement
nothing
could
be
seen
.
There
are
the
emblems
of
Durin	B-PER
!
cried
Gimli	B-PER
.
The
moon
as
it
rose
seemed
to
hang
for
a
moment
above
his
head
and
glistened
in
his
white
hair
as
the
wind
stirred
it
.
But
we
have
suffered
much
loss
in
our
battles
with
Saruman	B-PER
the
traitor
,
and
we
must
still
think
of
our
frontier
to
the
north
and
east
,
as
his
own
tidings
make
clear
.
’
Where
did
you
learn
such
tales
,
if
all
the
land
is
empty
and
forgetful
?
’
asked
Peregrin	B-PER
.
They
were
steering
,
as
well
as
they
could
guess
,
for
the
gate
like
opening
at
the
far
northward
end
of
the
long
valley
which
they
had
seen
in
the
morning
.
Day
is
drawing
to
an
end
,
yet
Gandalf	B-PER
says
you
must
go
ere
nightfall
,
and
the
Lord
of
the
Mark
is
eager
for
his
own
house
.
I
hope
so
,
said
Strider	B-PER
.
You
told
us
that
you
had
once
passed
through
the
Mines
.
I
must
be
trotting
.
Some
thing
scared
Mr.
Frodo	B-PER
badly
.
With
his
last
failing
senses
Frodo	B-PER
heard
cries
,
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
saw
,
beyond
the
Riders
that
hesitated
on
the
shore
,
a
shining
figure
of
white
light
;
and
behind
it
ran
small
shadowy
forms
waving
flames
,
that
flared
red
in
the
grey
mist
that
was
falling
over
the
world
.
Here's
the
Gate
,
and
it
looks
to
me
as
if
that's
about
as
far
as
we
are
ever
going
to
get
.
Gandalf	B-PER
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
span
,
leaning
on
the
staff
in
his
left
hand
,
but
in
his
other
hand
Glamdring
gleamed
,
cold
and
white
.
Maybe
you
re
right
,
said
Frodo	B-PER
,
avoiding
the
farmer's
eye
and
staring
at
the
fire
.
Yes
,
the
Ring
,
said
Merry	B-PER
.
Bless
you
,
Gimli	B-PER
,
son
of
Gloin	B-PER
!
Maybe
you
will
see
us
both
together
one
day
and
judge
between
us
!
But
the
hobbits
!
Legolas	B-PER
broke
in
.
They
halted
suddenly
on
the
edge
,
and
peered
through
the
tree
trunks
,
holding
their
breath
.
Well
,
that
was
years
ago
.
All
that
is
said
among
us
is
that
far
away
,
over
many
hills
and
rivers
,
live
the
halfling
folk
that
dwell
in
holes
in
sand
dunes
.
They
had
not
seen
the
Lord
and
Lady
again
,
and
they
had
little
speech
with
the
Elven
folk
;
for
few
of
these
knew
or
would
use
the
Westron
tongue
.
Had
you
this
thing
in
keeping
?
It
is
hidden
,
you
say
;
but
is
not
that
because
you
choose
to
hide
it
?
No
,
not
because
I
choose
,
answered
Frodo	B-PER
.
They
were
taken
by
surprise
.
A
golden
afternoon
of
late
sunshine
lay
warm
and
drowsy
upon
the
hidden
land
between
.
From
Lamedon	B-LOC
,
a
few
grim
hillmen
without
a
captain
.
All
know
in
Gondor	B-LOC
that
he
went
first
to
Minas	B-LOC
Anor	I-LOC
and
dwelt
a
while
with
his
nephew
Meneldil	B-PER
,
instructing
him
,
before
he
committed
to
him
the
rule
of
the
South	B-LOC
Kingdom	I-LOC
.
A
good
day
for
strolling
on
their
way
along
the
groves
and
glades
of
Ithilien	B-LOC
;
but
though
Orcs
may
shun
the
sunlight
.
Pippin	B-PER
sat
miserably
by
the
door
in
the
pitch
dark
;
but
he
kept
on
turning
round
,
fearing
that
some
unknown
thing
would
crawl
up
out
of
the
well
.
There
were
piles
of
refuse
everywhere
.
Ho
la
!
You
up
there
,
you
dunghill
rat
!
Stop
your
squeaking
,
or
I
ll
come
and
deal
with
you
.
Twitching
aside
his
grey
cloak
,
Pippin	B-PER
drew
forth
his
small
sword
and
laid
it
at
Denethor's	B-PER
feet
.
As
they
went
forward
the
hills
about
them
steadily
rose
.
Then
,
Eowyn	B-PER
of
Rohan	B-LOC
,
I
say
to
you
that
you
are
beautiful
.
An
eastward
bend
led
them
hard
by
the
sward
of
Mirrormere	B-LOC
,
and
there
not
far
from
the
roadside
stood
a
single
column
broken
at
the
top
.
We
must
be
off
,
he
said
.
See
,
my
precious
:
if
we
has
it
,
then
we
can
escape
,
even
from
Him
,
eh
?
Perhaps
we
grows
very
strong
,
stronger
than
Wraiths
.
It
was
moving
fast
then
,
muttered
Aragorn	B-PER
,
and
not
with
the
wind
.
If
you
mean
the
old
bogey
stories
Fatty's	B-PER
nurses
used
to
tell
him
,
about
goblins
and
wolves
and
things
of
that
sort
,
I
should
say
no
.
And
I
will
begin
that
tale
,
though
others
shall
end
it
.
Yet
that
would
have
to
be
done
that
very
night
,
before
they
all
went
to
bed
.
You
cannot
cross
the
rivers
again
,
and
behind
you
there
are
now
secret
sentinels
that
you
cannot
pass
.
There
you
are
,
Frodo	B-PER
!
said
Merry	B-PER
.
Yet
in
the
wizard's
face
he
saw
at
first
only
lines
of
care
and
sorrow
;
though
as
he
looked
more
intently
he
perceived
that
under
all
there
was
a
great
joy
:
a
fountain
of
mirth
enough
to
set
a
kingdom
laughing
,
were
it
to
gush
forth
.
Yet
not
no
hope
.
I
can't
stay
here
,
he
said
wildly
.
Never
did
I
make
a
greater
mistake
!
However
,
I
wrote
a
message
to
Frodo	B-PER
,
and
trusted
to
my
friend
the
innkeeper
to
send
it
to
him
.
At
the
same
moment
they
became
aware
that
the
hedges
on
both
sides
,
just
above
their
heads
,
were
all
lined
with
hobbits
.
Many
of
his
own
favourite
things
or
Bilbo's	B-PER
things
(
they
reminded
him
sharply
of
him
in
their
new
selling
)
were
arranged
as
nearly
as
possible
as
they
had
been
at
Bag	B-LOC
End	I-LOC
.
It
cannot
be
doubted
that
we
witness
the
meeting
of
dear
friends
,
said
Theoden	B-PER
.
Ai
oi
!
he
shouted
.
Nob	B-PER
trotted
off
with
a
grin
and
a
wink
.
He
was
altogether
wretched
.
Suddenly
Faramir	B-PER
stirred
,
and
he
opened
his
eyes
,
and
he
looked
on
Aragorn	B-PER
who
bent
over
him
;
and
a
light
of
knowledge
and
love
was
kindled
in
his
eyes
,
and
he
spoke
softly
.
Gandalf	B-PER
snuffed
the
air
and
looked
back
.
And
seen
closer
in
the
light
of
two
candles
that
he
lit
and
carried
before
them
the
landlord's
face
looked
rather
wrinkled
and
careworn
.
It
began
last
night
at
sunset
.
And
we
ll
save
the
Precious
,
as
we
promised
.
’
He
wished
them
good
night
,
and
they
said
no
more
;
but
Frodo	B-PER
could
see
in
the
lantern
light
that
the
man
was
still
eyeing
them
curiously
.
This
is
Sting
,
’
he
said
,
and
thrust
it
with
little
effort
deep
into
a
wooden
beam
.
The
landlord
introduced
the
newcomers
to
the
Bree	B-LOC
folk
,
so
quickly
that
,
though
they
caught
many
names
,
they
were
seldom
sure
who
the
names
belonged
to
.
Hey
!
Come
derry
dol
!
Hop
along
,
my
hearties
!
Hobbits
!
Ponies
all
!
We
are
fond
of
parties
.
We've
got
to
make
a
dash
for
it
!
All
right
,
Sam	B-PER
,
said
Frodo	B-PER
.
But
it
would
be
politer
in
any
case
for
the
challenger
to
say
who
he
is
.
Into
what
deadly
perils
he
had
gone
alone
I
dared
not
guess
.
Then
we
formed
our
conspiracy
;
and
as
we
were
serious
,
too
,
and
meant
business
,
we
have
not
been
too
scrupulous
.
For
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
set
out
only
just
in
time
,
if
indeed
you
are
in
time
.
Therefore
I
went
first
to
meet
him
and
hear
his
tale
.
What
does
he
want
for
it
?
Bill	B-PER
Ferny's	I-PER
price
was
twelve
silver
pennies
;
and
that
was
indeed
at
least
three
times
the
pony's
value
in
those
pans
.
Or
is
it
one
of
your
imitations
?
It
does
not
sound
altogether
encouraging
.
It
was
green
and
stagnant
,
thrust
out
like
a
slimy
arm
towards
the
enclos
ing
hills
.
Legolas	B-PER
and
I
wish
for
a
closer
view
.
Strider	B-PER
had
drawn
the
curtains
and
pushed
back
the
shutters
with
a
clang
.
Pale
waters
lapped
about
its
feet
.
Ride
on
!
Ride
on
!
cried
Glorfindel	B-PER
,
and
then
loud
and
clear
he
called
to
the
horse
in
the
elf
tongue
:
_noro
lim
,
noro
lim
,
Asfaloth
!
_
At
once
the
white
horse
sprang
away
and
sped
like
the
wind
along
the
last
lap
of
the
Road
.
Well
,
I
see
you
have
ideas
of
your
own
,
’
he
said
.
And
I
have
spent
most
of
the
years
since
then
in
finding
out
the
truth
of
it
.
And
we
d
better
be
a
bit
more
watchful
ourselves
,
or
we
ll
feel
some
nasty
fingers
round
our
necks
one
of
these
nights
,
if
we
ever
wake
up
to
feel
anything
.
O
nice
hobbits
!
Smeagol	B-PER
brings
them
up
secret
ways
that
nobody
else
could
find
.
And
are
not
the
bridges
of
Osgiliath	B-LOC
broken
down
and
all
the
landings
held
now
by
the
Enemy
?
On
which
side
will
you
journey
?
The
way
to
Minas	B-LOC
Tirith	I-LOC
lies
upon
this
side
,
upon
the
west
;
but
the
straight
road
of
the
Quest
lies
east
of
the
River
,
upon
the
darker
shore
.
You
can't
be
thinking
of
doing
that
.
Frodo	B-PER
wandered
round
the
familiar
rooms
,
and
saw
the
light
of
the
sunset
fade
on
the
walls
,
and
shadows
creep
out
of
the
corners
.
But
Shelob	B-PER
was
not
as
dragons
are
,
no
softer
spot
had
she
save
only
her
eyes
.
Tell
me
of
these
havens
as
we
walk
.
But
it
was
an
old
tradition
that
away
over
there
stood
the
Grey	B-LOC
Havens	I-LOC
,
from
which
at
times
elven
ships
set
sail
,
never
to
return
.
Were
the
breath
of
the
West
Wind
to
take
a
body
visible
,
even
so
would
it
appear
,
said
Eomer	B-PER
,
as
the
great
horse
ran
up
,
until
he
stood
before
the
wizard
.
Still
there's
seldom
less
than
a
score
round
the
Boss
,
as
they
names
him
.
Here
under
the
shadow
of
the
hills
there
had
been
some
rain
.
I
wish
to
help
you
.
Come
!
Do
as
you
promised
:
give
it
up
!
Well
,
if
you
want
my
ring
yourself
,
say
so
!
cried
Bilbo	B-PER
.
Well
,
have
a
care
!
said
Boromir	B-PER
.
These
things
the
Elves
of
Middle	B-LOC
earth	I-LOC
have
in
some
measure
gained
,
though
with
sorrow
.
True
words
doubtless
;
yet
all
such
comfort
is
cold
.
There
was
a
ring
and
clatter
as
the
Company	B-ORG
drew
their
swords
.
It
is
dry
at
least
,
and
there
is
food
,
though
no
fire
.
The
morning
was
now
far
advanced
.
He
tarried
there
from
errantry
,
and
melodies
they
taught
to
him
,
and
sages
old
him
marvels
told
,
and
harps
of
gold
they
brought
to
him
.
Who
are
you
,
and
what
do
you
want
?
I
am
called
Strider	B-PER
,
he
answered
:
and
though
he
may
have
forgotten
it
,
your
friend
promised
to
have
a
quiet
talk
with
me
.
They
had
a
struggle
to
get
out
of
the
thicket
.
He
looked
at
them
with
half
closed
eyes
.
We
have
two
more
ropes
.
We
were
just
wondering
where
it
would
be
safe
to
lie
and
get
some
sleep
,
when
the
most
amazing
thing
of
all
happened
.
’
But
in
that
time
also
he
made
this
scroll
,
’
said
Gandalf	B-PER
;
and
that
is
not
remembered
in
Gondor	B-LOC
,
it
would
seem
.
Why
had
his
master
let
him
sleep
on
out
of
turn
,
right
on
till
evening
?
Haven't
you
had
no
sleep
,
Mr.
Frodo	B-PER
?
he
said
.
He
needs
rest
.
All
along
it
for
many
leagues
east
of
the
Bridge
there
are
trees
growing
.
We
will
sit
on
the
edge
of
ruin
and
talk
,
as
Gandalf	B-PER
says
,
while
he
is
busy
elsewhere
.
A
fierce
eager
will
was
there
.
The
enemy
before
them
seemed
to
have
grown
rather
than
diminished
,
still
more
were
pressing
up
from
the
valley
through
the
breach
.
’
Too
warm
,
I
shouldn’t
wonder
,
’
muttered
Sam	B-PER
to
Frodo	B-PER
.
It's
heavy
on
me
,
Sam
lad
,
very
heavy
.
Gilgalad	B-LOC
is
_Starlight_
in
their
tongue
.
The
path
went
on
again
from
the
door
,
and
turning
to
the
right
again
across
the
level
space
plunged
down
a
thick
wooded
slope
.
The
Orcs
whom
we
pursued
took
captive
two
of
my
friends
.
In
the
afternoon
Ugluk's	B-PER
troop
overtook
the
Northerners
.
My
Precious
!
O
my
Precious
!
And
with
that
,
even
as
his
eyes
were
lifted
up
to
gloat
on
his
prize
,
he
stepped
too
far
,
toppled
,
wavered
for
a
moment
on
the
brink
,
and
then
with
a
shriek
he
fell
.
That
cheered
them
greatly
;
for
it
was
good
to
see
a
sight
of
anything
beyond
the
wood’s
borders
,
though
they
did
not
mean
to
go
that
way
,
if
they
could
help
it
:
the
Barrow	B-LOC
downs	I-LOC
had
as
sinister
a
reputation
in
hobbit
legend
as
the
Forest
itself
.
They
had
done
nearly
fourteen
miles
with
only
one
rest
at
noon
.
More
difficult
,
not
so
quick
;
but
better
,
if
we
don't
want
Him
to
see
.
Do
not
let
him
run
away
!
said
Boromir	B-PER
.
Beside
Glorfindel	B-PER
there
were
several
other
counsellors
of
Elrond’s	B-PER
household
,
of
whom
Erestor	B-PER
was
the
chief
;
and
with
him
was
Galdor	B-PER
,
an
Elf
from
the
Grey	B-LOC
Havens	I-LOC
who
had
come
on
an
errand
from
Cirdan	B-PER
the
Shipwright
.
The
travellers
now
rode
with
more
speed
,
and
they
made
their
way
towards
the
Gap	B-LOC
of	I-LOC
Rohan	I-LOC
;
and
Aragorn	B-PER
took
leave
of
them
at
last
close
to
that
very
place
where
Pippin	B-PER
had
looked
into
the
Stone
of
Orthanc	B-LOC
.
And
thereupon
the
middle
door
of
the
Black	B-LOC
Gate	I-LOC
was
thrown
open
with
a
great
clang
,
and
out
of
it
there
came
an
embassy
from
the
Dark	B-LOC
Tower	I-LOC
.
Leastways
old
Bilbo	B-PER
was
cracked
,
and
Frodo’s	B-PER
cracking
.
I
saw
a
dark
sky
,
and
tall
battlements
,
he
said
.
Go
on
!
’
said
Frodo	B-PER
.
Is
it
not
a
law
in
the
City
that
those
who
wear
the
black
and
silver
must
stay
in
the
Citadel
,
unless
their
lord
gives
them
leave
?
He
has
,
said
Pippin	B-PER
.
And
I
don't
wish
to
enter
it
even
once
,
said
Pippin	B-PER
.
It
depends
on
many
chances
.
Gloom
settled
still
more
heavily
on
Pippin	B-PER
.
He
felt
that
he
was
lying
in
a
soft
slimy
bog
,
and
springing
up
he
set
his
fool
on
the
corner
of
a
cold
hard
flagstone
.
It
is
no
good
saying
any
more
.
All
they
could
do
was
to
follow
the
fold
downwards
.
Why
that
way
,
I
wonder
?
He
turned
.
But
if
you
ll
pardon
my
speaking
out
,
I
think
my
master
was
right
.
Ever
the
horn
blasts
wound
on
among
the
hills
;
nearer
now
and
louder
they
answered
one
to
another
,
blowing
fierce
and
free
.
Well
,
’
the
farmer
continued
,
approaching
his
point
with
slow
relish
,
he
came
riding
on
a
big
black
horse
in
at
the
gate
,
which
happened
to
be
open
,
and
right
up
to
my
door
.
All
that
he
could
remember
about
Rohan	B-LOC
was
that
Gandalf's	B-PER
horse
,
Shadowfax	B-PER
,
had
come
from
that
land
.
Smeagol	B-PER
helps
again
.
We
cannot
go
further
tonight
,
’
said
Boromir	B-PER
.
I
think
,
nonetheless
,
that
we
no
longer
need
any
trail
to
tell
us
which
way
to
go
,
said
Gimli	B-PER
.
Do
Elves
live
in
those
woods
?
he
asked
.
Stone
rings
grinned
out
of
the
ground
like
broken
teeth
in
the
moonlight
.
Indeed
the
hobbits
felt
that
the
hair
on
their
heads
was
actually
standing
up
,
waving
and
curling
and
growing
.
Must
get
up
,
yes
they
must
!
he
said
.
In
pairs
they
galloped
by
,
and
though
every
now
and
then
one
rose
in
his
stirrups
and
gazed
ahead
and
to
either
side
,
they
appeared
not
to
perceive
the
three
strangers
sitting
silently
and
watching
them
.
But
he
came
too
late
,
for
once
,
and
the
battle
was
over
and
beyond
his
help
before
he
reached
these
parts
.
If
there
are
hobbit
folk
in
these
pans
,
why
don't
we
look
for
some
that
would
be
willing
to
take
us
in
?
It
would
be
more
homelike
.
We
feared
that
Saruman	B-PER
was
brewing
some
new
devilry
for
us
.
I
wonder
,
said
Strider	B-PER
,
looking
round
thoughtfully
.
Still
,
he
said
,
standing
suddenly
up
and
sticking
out
his
chin
.
All
that
day
the
Company	B-ORG
marched
on
,
until
they
felt
the
cool
evening
come
and
heard
the
early
night
wind
whispering
among
many
leaves
.
’
Legolas	B-PER
stirred
in
his
boat
.
Where
d
you
think
you
re
going
?
said
one
,
the
largest
and
most
evil
looking
of
the
crew
.
I
should
like
a
bit
of
information
as
well
as
danger
.
Some
I
cannot
trust
,
and
those
I
can
trust
are
too
dear
to
me
:
poor
old
Sam	B-PER
,
and
Merry	B-PER
and
Pippin	B-PER
.
He
sighed
.
As
Frodo	B-PER
prepared
to
follow
him
,
he
laid
his
hand
upon
the
tree
beside
the
ladder
:
never
before
had
he
been
so
suddenly
and
so
keenly
aware
of
the
feel
and
texture
of
a
tree's
skin
and
of
the
life
within
it
.
He
has
led
us
in
here
against
our
fears
,
but
he
will
lead
us
out
again
,
at
whatever
cost
to
himself
.
But
now
Frodo	B-PER
often
met
strange
dwarves
of
far
countries
,
seeking
refuge
in
the
West
.
There's
more
stored
in
your
head
than
you
let
on
about
.
’
Yes
,
it
all
comes
back
to
me
now
,
’
said
Frodo	B-PER
:
the
tremen
dous
roaring
.
I
will
not
do
this
deed
.
There
was
nothing
to
be
seen
.
He
knows
it
.
Think
of
the
riddles
they
both
knew
,
for
one
thing
.
Not
far
beyond
them
the
stream
becomes
clear
and
smooth
again
,
though
it
runs
swiftly
.
And
then
they
lost
no
more
time
.
A
strong
wind
from
the
West
was
now
driving
the
fumes
of
Mordor	B-LOC
from
the
upper
airs
.
I
should
know
,
for
I
had
one
to
tend
in
the
Houses
.
And
nothing
will
ever
be
all
right
where
that
piece
of
misery
is
.
’
Dangerous
or
not
,
a
real
sunrise
is
mighty
welcome
,
’
said
Frodo	B-PER
,
throwing
back
his
hood
and
letting
the
morning
light
fall
on
his
face
.
It
seemed
different
so
far
away
,
in
the
Shire	B-LOC
or
in
Rivendell	B-LOC
.
He
gazed
back
along
the
way
that
they
had
come
towards
the
night
gathering
in
the
East
.
Black
Riders
would
have
to
ride
over
him
to
get
near
the
waggon
.
At
last
lulled
by
the
wind
in
the
boughs
above
,
and
the
sweet
murmur
of
the
falls	B-LOC
of	I-LOC
Nimrodel	I-LOC
below
,
Frodo	B-PER
fell
asleep
with
the
song
of
Legolas	B-PER
running
in
his
mind
.
Yes
,
to
Mordor	B-LOC
,
’
said
Gandalf	B-PER
.
Beside
him
Merry	B-PER
lay
,
white
faced
,
with
a
dirty
rag
bound
across
his
brows
.
But
Aragorn	B-PER
dismounted
,
and
standing
by
the
Stone
he
cried
in
a
great
voice
:
Oathbreakers
,
why
have
ye
come
?
And
a
voice
was
heard
out
of
the
night
that
answered
him
,
as
if
from
far
away
:
To
fulfil
our
oath
and
have
peace
.
Before
long
they
had
all
passed
and
vanished
.
Soon
the
white
form
of
the
Lady
was
small
and
distant
.
Do
you
advise
me
to
look
?
asked
Frodo	B-PER
.
Ah
!
said
Aragorn	B-PER
.
And
then
there
are
some
trees
in
the
valleys
under
the
mountains
,
sound
as
a
bell
,
and
bad
right
through
.
The
rivers
long
defended
us
,
but
they
are
a
sure
guard
no
more
;
for
the
Shadow
has
crept
northward
all
about
us
.
There
are
none
.
In
their
dark
cloaks
they
were
as
invisible
as
if
they
all
had
magic
rings
.
Aragorn	B-PER
strode
on
through
the
inner
court
,
and
mounted
to
a
high
chamber
in
the
tower
.
Only
a
remnant
of
our
eastern
force
came
back
,
destroying
the
last
bridge
that
still
stood
amid
the
ruins	B-LOC
of	I-LOC
Osgiliath	I-LOC
.
Speak
no
more
of
it
!
But
so
it
is
,
Sam	B-PER
:
in
that
land
you
lost
your
count
.
It
is
cold
in
the
tree
tops
in
winter
,
though
the
wind
tonight
is
in
the
South
;
but
we
have
food
and
drink
to
give
you
that
will
drive
away
the
night
chill
,
and
we
have
skins
and
cloaks
to
spare
.
That’s
good
for
a
beginning
.
He
looked
on
the
bright
point
of
the
sword
.
They
roared
and
boomed
and
trumpeted
,
until
stones
began
to
crack
and
fall
at
the
mere
noise
of
them
.
’
The
night
wind
blew
chill
up
the
valley
to
meet
them
.
But
never
mind
.
The
three
hobbits
came
on
,
and
then
the
ruffians
turned
and
fled
running
away
up
the
Hobbiton	B-LOC
Road	I-LOC
;
but
they
blew
their
horns
as
they
ran
.
You
will
learn
that
your
trouble
is
but
part
of
the
trouble
of
all
the
western
world
.
I
reckon
it
isn't
safe
for
us
both
to
sleep
together
,
and
begging
your
pardon
,
but
I
can't
hold
up
my
lids
much
longer
.
So
I
stayed
there
that
night
,
wondering
much
what
had
become
of
the
Riders
;
for
only
of
two
had
there
yet
been
any
news
in
Bree	B-LOC
,
it
seemed
.
Give
me
your
bow
.
Great
trees
passed
by
like
ghosts
,
thrusting
their
twisted
thirsty
roots
through
the
mist
down
into
the
water
.
But
now
the
world
is
changing
once
again
.
The
dining
room
was
bare
except
for
a
table
and
chairs
,
but
the
food
was
good
,
and
there
was
good
wine
:
Frodo’s	B-PER
wine
had
not
been
included
in
the
sale
to
the
Sackville	B-PER
Bagginses	I-PER
.
The
world
was
darkling
.
The
others
slunk
away
.
I
have
returned
from
the
Northern	B-LOC
Fences	I-LOC
,
said
the
Elf
,
and
I
am
sent
now
to
be
your
guide
again
.
Swans
!
said
Sam	B-PER
.
Why
!
You
can't
see
to
the
bottom
in
this
light
.
It
will
not
be
any
comfort
to
us
,
if
these
riders
discover
that
we
are
not
Orcs
after
we
are
dead
.
Sam	B-PER
looked
at
Frodo	B-PER
.
Do
as
you
please
in
your
madness
,
but
let
me
first
get
down
from
this
horse
!
I
wish
to
see
no
eyes
!
Stay
,
Legolas	B-PER
Greenleaf	I-PER
!
said
Gandalf	B-PER
.
But
I
can't
keep
awake
any
longer
.
The
swords
flashed
from
the
sheath
as
one
.
They
just
want
a
match
,
though
,
and
they
ll
go
up
in
fire
.
I
need
a
change
,
or
something
.
The
cut
is
not
poisoned
,
as
the
wounds
of
orc
blades
too
often
are
.
My
heart
tells
me
that
Sauron	B-PER
will
expect
us
to
take
the
western
way
,
when
he
learns
what
has
befallen
.
The
day
waned
,
and
dusk
was
twined
about
the
boles
of
the
trees
.
Why
,
cousin
,
one
of
them
went
with
only
his
esquire
into
the
Black	B-LOC
Country	I-LOC
and
fought
with
the
Dark	B-PER
Lord	I-LORD
all
by
himself
,
and
set
fire
to
his
Tower
,
if
you
can
believe
it
.
Those
who
no
longer
wish
to
go
forward
may
remain
here
,
for
a
while
.
I’ll
say
you’re
dead
,
or
have
left
the
Shire	B-LOC
,
or
anything
you
like
.
