Strider
sat
silent
for
a
while
,
looking
at
the
hobbits
,
as
if
he
was
weighing
up
their
strength
and
courage
.
It
was
already
mid
day
when
they
drew
near
the
southern
end
of
the
path
,
and
saw
before
them
,
in
the
pale
clear
light
of
the
October
sun
,
a
grey
green
bank
,
leading
up
like
a
bridge
on
to
the
northward
slope
of
the
hill
They
decided
to
make
for
the
top
at
once
,
while
the
daylight
was
broad
Concealment
was
no
longer
possible
,
and
they
could
only
hope
that
no
enemy
or
spy
was
observing
them
.
But
I
thought
,
he
stammered
as
Elrond
turned
towards
him
,
I
thought
that
the
fall
of
Gil
galad
was
a
long
age
ago
.
There
ll
still
be
hours
of
dark
then
time
enough
for
you
to
take
us
a
long
march
,
if
you
know
the
way
.
They
shivered
.
It
cannot
be
less
than
forty
miles
from
West
door
to
East
gate
in
a
direct
line
,
and
the
road
may
wind
much
.
A
wall
,
too
,
the
men
of
old
had
made
from
the
Hornburg
to
the
southern
cliff
,
barring
the
entrance
to
the
gorge
.
_Hrum_
,
now
,
answered
the
voice
;
well
,
I
am
an
Ent
,
or
that
s
what
they
call
me
.
Sm
agol
is
hungry
,
said
Gollum
.
All
right
,
all
right
!
said
Sam
.
You
are
wise
,
and
cruel
.
Yes
,
sir
.
Clop
clop
,
clop
clop
.
There
s
hundreds
of
Shirriffs
all
told
and
they
want
more
,
with
all
these
new
rules
.
Before
long
the
Elves
came
down
the
lane
towards
the
valley
.
’
Bilbo
flushed
,
and
there
was
an
angry
light
in
his
eyes
.
Three
other
entrances
they
saw
,
dark
black
arches
:
one
straight
before
them
eastwards
,
and
one
on
either
side
.
Well
,
well
!
he
said
.
Come
with
me
,
Frodo
,
’
he
said
.
But
nothing
of
the
sort
.
But
Sm
agol
knows
it
.
I
should
like
to
beat
him
;
but
we
shall
see
.
I
hope
it
is
not
far
.
It
is
long
and
sad
,
for
it
tells
how
sorrow
came
upon
Lothl
rien
,
L
rien
of
the
Blossom
,
when
the
Dwarves
awakened
evil
in
the
mountains
.
As
a
matter
of
fact
I
heard
him
talking
to
a
stranger
,
who
seemed
to
be
inquiring
for
me
,
and
I
nearly
went
and
asked
him
who
it
was
.
Sam
Gamgee
was
sitting
in
one
corner
near
the
fire
,
and
opposite
him
was
Ted
Sandyman
,
the
miller’s
son
;
and
there
were
various
other
rustic
hobbits
listening
to
their
talk
.
And
if
we
decide
to
part
company
,
I
can
set
you
down
outside
my
country
at
any
point
you
choose
.
He
had
a
pocket
full
of
them
:
a
parting
present
from
Nob
and
Bob
.
It
s
like
a
bit
of
the
bad
old
times
tales
tell
of
,
I
say
.
And
that
may
be
an
encouraging
thought
.
I
shall
be
better
soon
.
Master
said
so
.
After
a
while
Aragorn
led
the
boats
back
upstream
.
I
think
you
must
have
fallen
asleep
on
your
feet
and
taken
the
wrong
turning
.
More
speed
we
cannot
make
,
if
the
strength
of
Rohan
is
to
be
gathered
.
Frodo
s
party
was
over
,
and
Gandalf
had
not
come
.
There
now
,
Mr.
Frodo
,
it
s
you
that
s
talking
of
water
this
time
!
said
Sam
.
As
soon
as
the
shadows
had
fallen
about
them
and
the
road
behind
was
dim
,
he
had
heard
again
the
quick
patter
of
feet
.
And
then
to
Sam
s
surprise
and
utter
confusion
he
bowed
his
knee
before
them
;
and
taking
them
by
the
hand
,
Frodo
upon
his
right
and
Sam
upon
his
left
,
he
led
them
to
the
throne
,
and
setting
them
upon
it
,
he
turned
to
the
men
and
captains
who
stood
by
and
spoke
,
so
that
his
voice
rang
over
all
the
host
,
crying
:
Praise
them
with
great
praise
!
And
when
the
glad
shout
had
swelled
up
and
died
away
again
,
to
Sam
s
final
and
complete
satisfaction
and
pure
joy
,
a
minstrel
of
Gondor
stood
forth
,
and
knelt
,
and
begged
leave
to
sing
.
Meanwhile
men
busied
themselves
about
the
cave
,
quietly
and
in
orderly
quickness
.
The
dusk
of
evening
seemed
to
grow
lighter
about
him
,
as
if
a
cloud
had
been
withdrawn
.
Amid
all
the
wreck
of
Isengard
this
seemed
to
them
the
strangest
sight
.
Have
I
got
it
wrong
?
he
muttered
.
I
could
not
find
him
again
.
He
will
go
himself
with
father
of
Horse
men
,
and
if
he
leads
you
wrong
,
you
will
kill
him
.
And
you
,
lady
,
leave
him
a
while
with
me
.
The
time
seemed
to
drag
interminably
.
I
beheld
the
last
combat
on
the
slopes
of
Orodruin
,
where
Gil
galad
died
,
and
Elendil
fell
,
and
Narsil
broke
beneath
him
;
but
Sauron
himself
was
overthrown
,
and
Isildur
cut
the
Ring
from
his
hand
with
the
hilt
shard
of
his
father
s
sword
,
and
took
it
for
his
own
.
The
pass
!
Run
,
run
,
and
we
ll
be
through
through
before
any
one
can
stop
us
!
Sam
came
up
behind
as
fast
as
he
could
urge
his
legs
;
but
glad
as
he
was
to
be
free
,
he
was
uneasy
,
and
as
he
ran
,
he
kept
on
glancing
back
at
the
dark
arch
of
the
tunnel
,
fearing
to
see
eyes
,
or
some
shape
beyond
his
imagining
,
spring
out
in
pursuit
.
But
going
straight
,
without
mishap
or
losing
our
way
,
we
shall
take
three
or
four
marches
,
I
expect
.
Now
then
,
if
all
is
as
you
wish
,
let
us
go
and
speak
with
your
master
.
Back
he
ran
down
the
steps
,
down
the
path
towards
Frodo
.
Nothing
was
moving
on
it
.
Far
away
a
figure
came
slowly
down
the
road
,
faint
and
small
at
first
,
but
growing
larger
and
clearer
as
it
approached
.
We’ll
just
wait
long
enough
for
winter
to
come
.
With
a
cry
Aragorn
roused
them
.
Though
Frodo
looked
about
him
on
every
side
he
saw
no
sign
of
the
great
stones
standing
like
a
gate
,
and
before
long
they
came
to
the
northern
gap
and
rode
swiftly
through
,
and
the
land
fell
away
before
them
.
It
was
Gil
galad
,
Elven
king
and
Elendil
of
Westernesse
who
overthrew
Sauron
,
though
they
themselves
perished
in
the
deed
;
and
Isildur
Elendil’s
son
cut
the
Ring
from
Sauron’s
hand
and
took
it
for
his
own
.
’
They
called
for
more
ale
,
and
began
to
shout
:
Let’s
have
it
again
,
master
!
Come
on
now
!
Once
more
!
’
They
made
Frodo
have
another
drink
,
and
then
begin
his
song
again
,
while
many
of
them
joined
in
;
for
the
tune
was
well
known
,
and
they
were
quick
at
picking
up
words
.
The
arm
that
was
broken
has
been
tended
with
due
skill
,
and
it
will
mend
in
time
,
if
she
has
the
strength
to
live
:
It
is
the
shield
arm
that
is
maimed
;
but
the
chief
evil
comes
through
the
sword
arm
.
It
s
no
laughing
matter
.
What
have
you
to
say
,
Th
oden
King
?
Will
you
have
peace
with
me
,
and
all
the
aid
that
my
knowledge
,
founded
in
long
years
,
can
bring
?
Shall
we
make
our
counsels
together
against
evil
days
,
and
repair
our
injuries
with
such
good
will
that
our
estates
shall
both
come
to
fairer
flower
than
ever
before
?
Still
Th
oden
did
not
answer
.
’
Why
?
Where
are
you
going
?
’
asked
Frodo
.
I
don
t
know
what
this
Man
has
been
up
to
.
I
can
t
manage
it
.
Mr.
Bilbo
never
did
a
kinder
deed
than
when
he
brought
the
lad
back
to
live
among
decent
folk
.
’
Sam
waved
his
arm
vaguely
:
neither
he
nor
any
of
them
knew
how
far
it
was
to
the
Sea
,
past
the
old
towers
beyond
the
western
borders
of
the
Shire
.
His
followers
fled
howling
,
as
Boromir
and
Aragorn
sprang
at
them
.
You
are
looking
now
south
west
across
the
north
plains
of
the
Riddermark
,
Rohan
the
land
of
the
Horse
lords
.
They
bowed
,
but
with
a
wave
of
her
arm
she
bade
them
look
round
;
and
they
looked
out
from
the
hill
top
over
lands
under
the
morning
.
It
is
far
more
powerful
than
I
ever
dared
to
think
at
first
,
so
powerful
that
in
the
end
it
would
utterly
overcome
anyone
of
mortal
race
who
possessed
it
.
We
are
journeying
east
and
cannot
go
further
tonight
.
What
about
helping
me
with
my
book
,
and
making
a
start
on
the
next
?
Have
you
thought
of
an
ending
?
’
Yes
,
several
,
and
all
are
dark
and
unpleasant
,
’
said
Frodo
.
Now
quicker
the
fiddle
went
deedle
dum
diddle
;
the
dog
began
to
roar
,
The
cow
and
the
horses
stood
on
their
heads
;
The
guests
all
bounded
from
their
beds
and
danced
upon
the
floor
.
We
might
try
to
hurt
or
frighten
this
tree
to
begin
with
,
said
Sam
fiercely
.
Hail
Lord
of
the
Rohirrim
,
friend
of
Gondor
!
he
said
.
But
it
looked
like
the
old
Sam
Gamgee
sitting
there
,
except
that
his
face
was
unusually
thoughtful
.
What
is
it
all
about
?
It
is
mine
isn
t
it
?
I
found
it
,
and
Gollum
would
have
killed
me
,
if
I
hadn
t
kept
it
.
His
face
was
twisted
with
amazement
and
anger
to
the
likeness
of
some
wild
beast
that
,
as
it
crouches
on
its
prey
,
is
smitten
on
the
muzzle
with
a
stinging
rod
.
Here
all
are
enemies
of
the
one
Enemy
,
and
yet
I
must
walk
blind
,
while
the
sun
is
merry
in
the
woodland
under
leaves
of
gold
!
Folly
it
may
seem
,
said
Haldir
.
Then
far
below
,
as
if
the
stone
had
fallen
into
deep
water
in
some
cavernous
place
,
there
came
a
plunk
,
very
distant
,
but
magni
fied
and
repeated
in
the
hollow
shaft
.
’
I
am
glad
to
find
you
visible
,
’
replied
the
wizard
,
sitting
down
in
a
chair
,
I
wanted
to
catch
you
and
have
a
few
final
words
.
But
most
of
the
traffic
went
out
along
the
chief
highway
,
and
that
turned
south
,
and
then
bending
swifter
than
the
River
skirted
the
hills
and
passed
soon
from
sight
.
Then
they
rested
and
slept
without
fear
upon
the
ground
;
for
their
guides
would
not
permit
them
to
unbind
their
eyes
,
and
they
could
not
climb
.
It
flows
down
out
of
the
Ettenmoors
,
the
troll
fells
north
of
Rivendell
,
and
joins
the
Loudwater
away
in
the
South
.
In
breadth
it
looked
to
be
no
more
than
two
or
three
furlongs
at
the
widest
point
.
Helms
too
they
chose
,
and
round
shields
:
their
bosses
were
overlaid
with
gold
and
set
with
gems
,
green
and
red
and
white
.
’
No
,
don’t
give
the
ring
to
me
,
’
said
Gandalf
.
If
there
s
any
game
,
me
and
my
lads
must
be
in
it
.
Hoom
,
hmm
!
Come
now
!
Not
so
hasty
!
You
call
_yourselves_
hobbits
?
But
you
should
not
go
telling
just
anybody
.
They
were
being
headed
off
,
and
were
simply
following
a
course
chosen
for
them
eastwards
and
southwards
,
into
the
heart
of
the
Forest
and
not
out
of
it
.
Here
they
come
pouring
through
the
breaches
!
And
they
carry
torches
,
it
seems
.
I
have
no
doubt
that
Smeagol’s
grandmother
was
a
matriarch
,
a
great
person
in
her
way
,
but
to
talk
of
her
possessing
many
Elven
rings
was
absurd
,
and
as
for
giving
them
away
,
it
was
a
lie
.
Little
cheat
.
The
marching
stones
faded
slowly
from
sight
,
but
still
beyond
them
,
blacker
than
the
gloom
,
brooded
the
vast
crouching
shadow
of
the
Dwimorberg
.
And
the
ship
went
out
into
the
High
Sea
and
passed
on
into
the
West
,
until
at
last
on
a
night
of
rain
Frodo
smelled
a
sweet
fragrance
on
the
air
and
heard
the
sound
of
singing
that
came
over
the
water
.
Choose
one
spot
as
a
nursery
,
and
see
what
happens
to
the
plants
there
,
said
Merry
.
Come
!
Wake
up
Mr.
Frodo
!
he
said
,
trying
to
sound
as
cheerful
as
he
had
when
he
drew
back
the
curtains
at
Bag
End
on
a
summer
s
morning
.
After
half
an
hour
Pippin
said
:
I
hope
we
have
not
turned
too
much
towards
the
south
,
and
are
not
walking
longwise
through
this
wood
!
It
is
not
a
very
broad
belt
I
should
have
said
no
more
than
a
mile
at
the
widest
and
we
ought
to
have
been
through
it
by
now
.
Gandalf
took
no
notice
of
them
.
Suddenly
the
great
bow
of
Lorien
sang
.
The
perishing
is
more
likely
,
and
will
be
a
lot
easier
anyway
,
he
said
grimly
to
himself
,
as
he
sheathed
Sting
and
turned
from
the
brazen
doors
.
Where
now
she
wanders
none
can
tell
,
In
sunlight
or
in
shade
;
For
lost
of
yore
was
Nimrodel
And
in
the
mountains
strayed
.
The
gate
opened
and
three
huge
dogs
came
pelting
out
into
the
lane
,
and
dashed
towards
the
travellers
,
barking
fiercely
.
Can’t
anything
be
done
,
Mr.
Butterbur
?
’
asked
Frodo
.
They
were
gone
.
To
be
very
very
good
,
said
Gollum
.
Anyone
coming
with
me
to
Tuckborough
?
Pippin
rode
off
with
half
a
dozen
lads
on
ponies
.
Come
back
!
Leave
your
game
and
sit
down
beside
me
!
We
must
talk
a
while
more
,
and
think
about
the
morning
.
What
Lugb
rz
will
do
with
such
stuff
I
can
t
guess
.
But
not
alone
.
If
you
want
to
know
,
I
am
just
writing
an
ending
for
it
.
Gorbag
and
Shagrat
were
already
on
the
threshold
.
But
soon
Haldir
turned
aside
into
the
trees
and
halted
on
the
bank
of
the
river
under
their
shadows
.
It
s
going
to
be
thick
,
said
Maggot
;
but
I
ll
not
light
my
lantern
till
I
turn
for
home
.
Ever
they
circled
above
the
City
,
like
vultures
that
expect
their
fill
of
doomed
men
s
flesh
.
No
one
ever
found
out
what
had
become
of
Deal
;
he
was
murdered
far
from
home
,
and
his
body
was
cunningly
hidden
.
He
deserves
death
.
When
Frodo
came
to
himself
he
was
still
clutching
the
Ring
desperately
.
But
now
he
saw
that
they
were
in
danger
of
being
caught
in
the
very
midst
of
the
great
battle
that
would
soon
be
joined
.
Merry
was
not
far
away
.
I
should
like
to
write
the
second
book
,
if
I
am
spared
.
Do
you
not
hear
their
voices
?
I
hear
them
,
said
omer
;
but
they
are
only
the
scream
of
birds
and
the
bellowing
of
beasts
to
my
ears
.
In
Moria
,
in
Khazad
dum
!
But
it
makes
the
darkness
seem
heavier
,
thinking
of
all
those
lamps
.
Each
had
three
joined
bodies
,
and
three
heads
facing
outward
,
and
inward
,
and
across
the
gateway
.
Frodo
was
in
the
water
close
to
the
edge
,
and
a
great
tree
root
seemed
to
be
over
him
and
holding
him
down
,
but
he
was
not
struggling
.
It
seemed
that
the
Orcs
had
pressed
on
with
all
possible
speed
.
Sam
guessed
that
among
all
their
pains
he
bore
the
worst
,
the
growing
weight
of
the
Ring
,
a
burden
on
the
body
and
a
torment
to
his
mind
.
For
if
ever
we
come
through
this
darkness
,
many
leagues
lie
beyond
,
and
every
hour
that
is
lost
there
will
bring
the
triumph
of
Sauron
nearer
.
He
halted
listening
.
It
was
now
past
mid
day
,
and
they
felt
it
was
high
time
for
lunch
.
I
have
seen
a
good
deal
of
you
.
That
Gandalf
should
be
late
,
does
not
bode
well
.
Don
t
you
know
my
name
yet
?
That
s
the
only
answer
.
then
you
must
help
me
.
Stop
him
,
Legolas
!
Did
I
not
say
that
I
wished
to
speak
to
you
?
said
the
old
man
.
A
trailing
plant
with
flowers
like
small
white
stars
had
bound
itself
across
the
brows
as
if
in
reverence
for
the
fallen
king
,
and
in
the
crevices
of
his
stony
hair
yellow
stonecrop
gleamed
.
He
showed
no
signs
of
age
.
There
s
a
tidy
bit
of
money
tucked
away
up
there
,
I
hear
tell
,
said
a
stranger
,
a
visitor
on
business
from
Michel
Delving
in
the
Westfarthing
.
Swiftly
may
he
bear
me
back
again
!
Gandalf
spoke
now
to
Shadowfax
,
and
the
horse
set
off
at
a
good
pace
,
yet
not
beyond
the
measure
of
the
others
.
Sam
sighed
audibly
;
and
not
at
the
courtesies
,
of
which
,
as
any
hobbit
would
,
he
thoroughly
approved
.
I
almost
wish
that
my
adventures
were
not
over
,
and
that
I
could
go
with
him
when
his
day
comes
.
Good
master
!
Then
rest
now
,
nice
hobbits
,
under
the
shadow
of
the
stones
,
close
under
the
stones
!
Rest
and
lie
quiet
,
till
the
Yellow
Face
goes
away
.
They
are
not
permitted
in
our
land
.
When
she
s
hunting
,
she
just
gives
em
a
dab
in
the
neck
and
they
go
as
limp
as
boned
fish
,
and
then
she
has
her
way
with
them
.
The
land
must
groan
under
their
hated
feet
.
A
dark
water
was
before
him
,
and
he
was
crawling
on
the
ground
,
this
way
and
that
,
doubtful
of
the
way
.
Jumped
over
the
Moon
!
chuckled
Merry
as
he
rolled
himself
in
his
blanket
.
There’s
more
behind
this
than
sun
and
warm
air
,
’
he
muttered
to
himself
.
Bill
,
my
lad
,
he
said
,
you
oughtn
t
to
have
took
up
with
us
.
The
Lord
Sauron
the
Great
,
so
he
said
,
wished
for
our
friendship
.
Their
dark
withered
plumes
bent
and
tossed
in
the
light
cold
airs
,
hissing
softly
and
sadly
.
And
with
a
piercing
cry
out
of
the
dim
sky
fell
the
winged
shadows
,
the
Nazg
l
stooping
to
the
kill
.
There
could
be
no
return
.
Where
to
?
Off
East
.
But
now
we
must
part
for
a
while
.
And
if
that
was
not
enough
,
he
was
given
a
whole
list
of
names
,
beginning
with
Old
Barliman
here
,
to
whom
he
could
go
for
further
information
.
Let
the
fire
die
rather
!
Call
me
at
need
!
With
that
he
fell
asleep
.
Most
likely
neither
of
us
will
come
back
.
Again
and
again
the
great
rams
swung
and
crashed
.
Keep
near
to
this
edge
and
the
skirts
of
the
forest
.
On
two
chairs
beneath
the
bole
of
the
tree
and
canopied
by
a
living
bough
there
sat
,
side
by
side
,
Celeborn
and
Galadriel
.
He
seemed
mighty
pleased
with
it
.
’
The
Company
now
went
down
the
road
from
the
Gates
.
I
fear
that
he
will
not
come
now
,
said
omer
.
Here
and
there
through
openings
Frodo
could
catch
sudden
glimpses
of
rolling
meads
,
and
far
beyond
them
hills
in
the
sunset
,
and
away
on
the
edge
of
sight
a
dark
line
,
where
marched
the
southernmost
ranks
of
the
Misty
Mountains
.
If
I’ve
done
any
harm
,
I’m
sorry
indeed
.
We
are
walking
west
along
the
Entwash
.
The
dark
figure
raised
its
head
and
uncovered
its
face
.
Even
if
all
goes
well
,
I
could
hardly
reach
the
Mountain
in
a
week
.
Just
in
time
he
threw
himself
down
in
a
patch
of
long
grass
behind
a
tree
that
overshadowed
the
road
.
It
was
his
turn
to
sleep
first
,
and
he
was
soon
deep
in
a
dream
.
Then
he
stretched
himself
out
,
dizzy
and
weary
,
and
he
spoke
no
more
for
a
while
.
You
might
be
a
play
acting
spy
,
for
all
I
can
see
,
trying
to
get
us
to
go
with
you
.
I
had
not
thought
of
that
.
Look
!
he
said
,
clutching
Frodo
by
the
arm
.
For
these
things
are
given
to
serve
you
when
all
else
fails
.
It
is
a
great
water
before
it
finds
the
Sea
.
If
we
had
come
by
the
main
road
down
from
the
upper
halls
,
we
should
have
been
trapped
here
,
said
Gandalf
.
he
shouted
as
he
leaped
down
the
stair
from
the
Rock
with
many
men
of
Westfold
at
his
back
.
As
she
stood
before
Aragorn
she
paused
suddenly
and
looked
upon
him
,
and
her
eyes
were
shining
.
His
heart
is
as
rotten
as
a
black
Huorn
s
.
They
both
looked
terrified
.
But
then
we
don
t
know
much
about
Men
in
the
Shire
,
except
perhaps
the
Breelanders
.
And
I
d
make
him
look
for
turnips
and
carrots
,
and
taters
too
,
if
it
was
the
time
o
the
year
.
Then
you
must
take
a
new
leader
and
follow
him
as
best
you
can
.
But
we
are
the
fighters
.
All
round
the
knoll
on
which
the
Orcs
were
gathered
little
watch
fires
sprang
up
,
golden
red
in
the
darkness
,
a
complete
ring
of
them
.
He
plunged
off
in
the
direction
of
the
call
,
and
found
himself
going
steeply
uphill
.
You
will
meet
many
foes
,
some
open
,
and
some
disguised
;
and
you
may
find
friends
upon
your
way
when
you
least
look
for
it
.
In
this
hour
take
the
name
that
was
foretold
for
you
,
Elessar
,
the
Elfstone
of
the
house
of
Elendil
!
Then
Aragorn
took
the
stone
and
pinned
the
brooch
upon
his
breast
,
and
those
who
saw
him
wondered
;
for
they
had
not
marked
before
how
tall
and
kingly
he
stood
,
and
it
seemed
to
them
that
many
years
of
toil
had
fallen
from
his
shoulders
.
It
is
long
since
the
people
of
Nimrodel
left
the
woodlands
of
L
rien
,
and
yet
still
one
may
see
that
not
all
sailed
from
Amroth
s
haven
west
over
water
.
Sam
soon
became
aware
that
the
Captain
was
not
satisfied
with
Frodo
s
account
of
himself
at
several
points
:
what
part
he
had
to
play
in
the
Company
that
set
out
from
Rivendell
;
why
he
had
left
Boromir
;
and
where
he
was
now
going
.
Will
you
still
order
my
goings
,
and
are
you
not
content
with
my
ruin
?
You
know
the
answers
,
said
Gandalf
:
no
and
no
.
In
places
it
was
now
faint
and
overgrown
,
or
choked
with
fallen
stones
and
trees
;
but
at
one
time
it
seemed
to
have
been
much
used
.
Your
master
is
not
himself
,
he
said
.
In
the
darkness
it
was
hard
to
be
sure
that
they
were
indeed
moving
at
all
;
but
slowly
the
swirl
of
the
water
grew
less
,
and
the
shadow
of
the
eastern
bank
faded
back
into
the
night
.
Gandalf
and
the
King
s
company
rode
away
,
turning
eastward
to
make
the
circuit
of
the
ruined
walls
of
Isengard
.
Yet
maybe
there
is
now
more
hope
in
your
search
,
said
Aragorn
.
When
the
battle
was
over
,
we
found
that
Gollum
was
gone
,
and
his
guards
were
slain
or
taken
.
But
in
the
wearing
of
the
swift
years
of
Middle
earth
the
line
of
Meneldil
son
of
An
rion
failed
,
and
the
Tree
withered
,
and
the
blood
of
the
N
menoreans
became
mingled
with
that
of
lesser
men
.
Still
I
see
what
she
means
.
Not
feared
,
save
as
men
may
fear
the
dignity
of
a
man
,
old
and
wise
.
He
seemed
to
shrink
down
,
cowed
by
age
.
Have
you
not
done
this
and
little
more
in
all
the
days
of
Denethor
?
But
no
!
I
said
this
would
be
prudent
.
You
are
indeed
high
in
the
favour
of
the
Lady
!
For
she
herself
and
her
maidens
wove
this
stuff
;
and
never
before
have
we
clad
strangers
in
the
garb
of
our
own
people
.
At
breakfast
?
’
He
walked
away
towards
the
edge
of
the
green
.
Almost
as
bad
as
Orcs
,
and
much
bigger
.
As
soon
as
Strider
had
roused
them
all
,
he
led
the
way
to
their
bedrooms
.
But
he
did
not
feel
comfortable
.
I
cannot
say
.
He
lurched
and
stumbled
.
Then
he
gave
Frodo
his
mithril
coat
and
Sting
,
forgetting
that
he
had
already
done
so
;
and
he
gave
him
also
three
books
of
lore
that
he
had
made
at
various
times
,
written
in
his
spidery
hand
,
and
labelled
on
their
red
backs
:
_Translations
from
the
Elvish
,
by
B
.
In
seven
days
we
will
go
,
said
Aragorn
.
That
was
his
ruin
.
In
panoply
of
ancient
kings
,
in
chain
d
rings
he
armoured
him
;
his
shining
shield
was
scored
with
runes
to
ward
all
wounds
and
harm
from
him
;
his
bow
was
made
of
dragon
horn
,
his
arrows
shorn
of
ebony
,
of
silver
was
his
habergeon
,
his
scabbard
of
chalcedony
;
his
sword
of
steel
was
valiant
,
of
adamant
his
helmet
tall
,
an
eagle
plume
upon
his
crest
,
upon
his
breast
an
emerald
.
Are
enemies
at
hand
?
Let
us
see
what
Sting
may
show
,
answered
Aragorn
.
At
last
he
passed
into
uneasy
sleep
.
Don
t
stare
,
as
if
you
had
never
heard
the
strange
name
before
.
You
would
have
become
a
wraith
under
the
dominion
of
the
Dark
Lord
;
and
he
would
have
tormented
you
for
trying
to
keep
his
Ring
,
if
any
greater
torment
were
possible
than
being
robbed
of
it
and
seeing
it
on
his
hand
.
As
soon
as
it
was
fully
light
they
started
.
It
had
been
built
long
ago
when
the
traffic
on
the
roads
had
been
far
greater
.
Yet
Saruman
is
apt
to
overlook
his
bargains
.
My
advice
is
:
stay
there
!
And
don
t
get
mixed
up
with
these
outlandish
folk
.
He
coiled
it
up
and
stowed
it
lovingly
in
his
pack
.
Come
,
come
!
he
shouted
,
swinging
his
axe
.
A
sound
like
a
sigh
went
up
from
all
the
lands
about
them
;
and
their
hearts
beat
suddenly
again
.
You
will
be
helping
your
own
friends
that
way
,
too
;
for
if
Saruman
is
not
checked
Rohan
and
Gondor
will
have
an
enemy
behind
as
well
as
in
front
.
He
had
said
farewell
to
owyn
above
in
the
Hold
,
and
the
memory
was
grievous
;
but
now
he
turned
his
mind
to
the
road
that
lay
ahead
.
But
those
who
go
with
it
must
not
count
on
their
errand
being
aided
by
war
or
force
.
And
Boromir
will
tell
you
that
that
is
a
great
open
vale
that
lies
between
the
Misty
Mountains
and
the
northmost
foothills
of
Ered
Nimrais
,
the
White
Mountains
of
his
home
.
As
Elrond
entered
and
went
towards
the
seat
prepared
for
him
,
elvish
minstrels
began
to
make
sweet
music
.
File
after
file
passed
,
and
the
tell
tale
torchlight
was
already
some
way
ahead
.
Many
paths
were
made
when
Stonehouse
folk
were
stronger
.
’
He
then
pointed
out
and
named
those
whom
Frodo
had
not
met
before
.
It
was
cracked
and
weather
worn
,
and
the
faint
runes
upon
its
side
could
not
be
read
.
When
the
fighting
was
over
,
and
the
later
labours
were
ordered
,
Merry
,
Pippin
,
and
Sam
joined
him
,
and
they
rode
back
with
the
Cottons
.
But
the
ruffian
flung
it
at
his
head
and
then
darted
out
into
the
darkness
.
He
suddenly
remembered
his
master
.
The
Riders
hardly
glanced
at
them
.
Hullo
,
Pippin
!
he
said
.
It
was
a
path
made
by
strong
arms
and
heavy
feet
.
Ai
!

We
should
have
had
messages
,
even
if
he
could
not
come
himself
.
I
will
make
you
some
toast
.
Their
cries
and
the
tramp
of
their
feet
passed
into
the
City
and
died
away
.
Don
t
be
absurd
!
said
Frodo
.
And
look
closely
!
’
As
Frodo
did
so
,
he
now
saw
fine
lines
,
finer
than
the
finest
pen
strokes
,
running
along
the
ring
,
outside
and
inside
:
lines
of
fire
that
seemed
to
form
the
letters
of
a
flowing
script
.
Come
on
,
Mr.
Frodo
!
Frodo
raised
his
head
,
and
then
stood
up
.
But
he
shall
not
turn
us
back
!
Halt
we
must
once
more
;
for
,
see
!
even
the
Moon
is
falling
into
gathering
cloud
.
He
almost
called
aloud
the
wizard’s
name
,
and
then
he
saw
that
the
figure
was
clothed
not
in
grey
but
in
white
,
in
a
white
that
shone
faintly
in
the
dusk
;
and
in
its
hand
there
was
a
white
staff
.
Far
away
down
in
the
Bay
of
Belfalas
,
to
which
Anduin
runs
,
it
is
warm
and
merry
,
maybe
,
or
would
be
but
for
the
Enemy
.
Behold
Eorl
the
Young
!
said
Aragorn
.
I
didn
t
mean
that
,
said
Sam
.
No
,
no
!
said
Gollum
.
Sauron
does
not
use
the
Elf
runes
.
Eat
them
,
eat
them
!
He
clawed
at
the
nearest
rabbit
,
already
skinned
and
lying
by
the
fire
.
Strider
I
am
to
one
fat
man
who
lives
within
a
day’s
march
of
foes
that
would
freeze
his
heart
,
or
lay
his
little
town
in
ruin
,
if
he
were
not
guarded
ceaselessly
.
There
was
some
laughing
and
clapping
:
the
audience
seemed
to
think
that
Ted
had
scored
a
point
.
Frodo
wondered
if
the
remark
meant
more
than
it
said
.
There
was
a
lot
more
,
said
Sam
,
all
about
Mordor
.
’
And
heard
she
pushed
him
in
,
and
he
pulled
her
in
after
him
,
’
said
Sandyman
,
the
Hobbiton
miller
.
We
tracked
you
as
far
as
the
forest
,
but
there
are
still
many
things
that
I
should
like
to
know
the
truth
of
.
They
are
wrought
of
ithildin
that
mirrors
only
starlight
and
moon
light
,
and
sleeps
until
it
is
touched
by
one
who
speaks
words
now
long
forgotten
in
Middle
earth
.
Except
in
one
point
:
they
were
fond
of
boats
,
and
some
of
them
could
swim
.
Far
off
,
as
in
a
little
picture
drawn
by
elven
fingers
he
saw
the
Lady
Galadriel
standing
on
the
grass
in
L
rien
,
and
gifts
were
in
her
hands
.
Gimli
strode
forward
undeterred
,
and
found
that
the
water
was
shallow
,
no
more
than
ankle
deep
at
the
edge
.
And
last
of
all
Aragorn
greeted
omer
of
Rohan
,
and
they
embraced
,
and
Aragorn
said
:
Between
us
there
can
be
no
word
of
giving
or
taking
,
nor
of
reward
;
for
we
are
brethren
.
You
will
have
no
claim
,
’
said
Haldir
.
For
the
Elves
the
world
moves
,
and
it
moves
both
very
swift
and
very
slow
.
Does
that
not
tell
you
something
of
him
?
It
does
,
said
Frodo
.
Be
careful
of
your
words
,
Master
Peregrin
!
This
is
no
time
for
hobbit
pertness
.
He
felt
his
body
and
limbs
gently
,
and
took
his
friend
s
hands
in
his
own
.
He
looked
at
me
sidelong
,
and
paused
a
while
considering
.
Then
what
would
you
have
me
do
?
I
know
not
.
And
away
in
the
North
west
there
seemed
to
be
another
darkness
brooding
about
the
feet
of
the
Misty
Mountains
,
a
shadow
that
crept
down
slowly
from
the
Wizard
s
Vale
.
I
hear
nothing
but
the
night
speech
of
plant
and
stone
,
’
he
said
.
For
you
I
have
prepared
this
.
Altogether
1420
in
the
Shire
was
a
marvellous
year
.
That
is
the
road
to
the
left
.
He
d
already
bought
Sandyman
s
mill
before
he
came
to
Bag
End
,
seemingly
.
You
must
now
make
haste
,
and
neither
stay
nor
turn
back
;
for
the
Shire
is
no
longer
any
protection
to
you
.
And
not
only
in
dealing
with
that
,
_hoom_
,
that
accursed
tree
slayer
that
dwelt
here
.
But
if
I
was
in
your
plight
,
I
wouldn
t
take
up
with
a
Ranger
.
He
told
me
that
his
business
with
you
had
gone
well
,
and
that
you
would
be
starting
for
Rivendell
in
the
last
week
of
September
.
A
wild
light
flamed
in
his
eyes
,
but
his
malice
was
no
longer
matched
by
his
old
griping
strength
.
The
further
you
go
,
the
less
easy
will
it
be
to
withdraw
;
yet
no
oath
or
bond
is
laid
on
you
to
go
further
than
you
will
.
Thus
men
reached
at
last
the
High
Court
,
and
the
Place
of
the
Fountain
before
the
feet
of
the
White
Tower
:
tall
and
shapely
,
fifty
fathoms
from
its
base
to
the
pinnacle
,
where
the
banner
of
the
Stewards
floated
a
thousand
feet
above
the
plain
.
I
m
sorry
,
but
you
startled
me
out
of
my
sleep
.
Just
a
plain
hobbit
you
look
,
’
said
Bilbo
.
I
may
find
means
to
persuade
you
.
He
made
them
describe
the
Shire
and
its
country
over
and
over
again
.
You
shall
watch
;
but
only
if
you
promise
to
wake
me
halfway
towards
morning
,
if
nothing
happens
before
then
.
I
don
t
know
.
Up
he
went
and
sat
upon
the
ancient
chair
,
feeling
like
a
lost
child
that
had
clambered
upon
the
throne
of
mountain
kings
.
’
He
turned
to
go
back
,
and
then
stopped
,
for
he
heard
voices
,
just
round
the
corner
by
the
end
of
Bagshot
Row
.
There
indeed
at
the
bottom
was
a
coil
of
the
silken
grey
rope
made
by
the
folk
of
L
rien
.
At
last
all
was
removed
and
laid
on
the
portage
way
.
And
Saruman
?
But
great
though
his
lore
may
be
,
it
must
have
a
source
.
The
enemy
is
at
hand
!
they
said
.
I
m
going
right
on
,
Mr.
Frodo
!
he
cried
.
Wait
!
You
can
t
do
anything
without
a
rope
.
He
has
long
studied
it
,
seeking
the
lost
secrets
of
their
making
;
but
when
the
Rings
were
debated
in
the
Council
,
all
that
he
would
reveal
to
us
of
his
ring
lore
told
against
my
fears
.
That
you
certainly
are
not
,
said
Gimli
.
Big
fight
,
and
who
will
win
?
And
many
more
walk
round
walls
of
Stone
houses
.
The
Orcs
reached
the
tunnel
and
were
passing
in
.
Now
what
is
to
be
done
?
Fur
the
moment
nothing
,
but
to
prop
himself
against
the
unmoving
stone
and
listen
,
listen
to
the
vile
orc
voices
.
The
tidings
that
I
was
sent
to
bring
must
now
be
told
.
At
last
the
hobbits
saw
,
rising
dimly
before
them
,
a
steep
dark
land
:
they
had
come
to
the
feet
of
the
mountains
,
and
to
the
green
roots
of
tall
Methedras
.
I
can
see
a
darkness
.
Yes
,
said
Gandalf
,
these
doors
are
probably
governed
by
words
.
The
Elder
Days
are
gone
.
Rest
while
you
can
,
little
fool
!
he
said
then
to
Pippin
,
in
the
Common
Speech
,
which
he
made
almost
as
hideous
as
his
own
language
.
’
Who
will
laugh
,
I
wonder
?
’
said
Gandalf
,
shaking
his
head
.
Yet
even
as
I
write
it
is
cooled
,
and
it
seemeth
to
shrink
,
though
it
loseth
neither
its
beauty
nor
its
shape
.
It
was
dark
.
When
Treebeard
had
got
a
few
arrows
in
him
,
he
began
to
warm
up
,
to
get
positively
hasty
,
as
he
would
say
.
His
knees
gave
,
and
he
fell
on
the
ground
.
Gollum’s
sharp
ears
would
soon
learn
what
he
wanted
.
But
that
no
longer
troubles
him
.
The
Seven
are
lost
to
us
if
Balin
has
not
found
the
ring
of
Thr
r
which
was
the
last
;
naught
has
been
heard
of
it
since
Thr
r
perished
in
Moria
.
A
star
was
bound
upon
her
brows
,
A
light
was
on
her
hair
As
sun
upon
the
golden
boughs
In
L
rien
the
fair
.
But
a
small
dark
figure
that
none
had
observed
sprang
out
of
the
shadows
and
gave
a
hoarse
shout
:
_
Baruk
Khaz
d
!
Khaz
d
ai
m
nu
!
_
An
axe
swung
and
swept
back
.
No
,
_not_
everything
,
Mr.
Frodo
.
It
was
through
a
mist
that
presently
he
saw
the
van
of
the
men
of
Gondor
approaching
.
If
we
kill
him
,
we
must
kill
him
outright
.
It
was
Mr.
Bilbo
as
taught
me
my
letters
.
It
is
a
fair
tale
,
though
it
is
sad
,
as
are
all
the
tales
of
Middle
earth
,
and
yet
it
may
lift
up
your
hearts
.
Most
of
the
inhabitants
of
Bree
and
Staddle
,
and
many
even
from
Combe
and
Archet
,
were
crowded
in
the
road
to
see
the
travellers
start
.
No
you
don’t
,
Sam
!
’
said
Pippin
.
He
heard
Frodo’s
voice
,
but
it
seemed
to
come
from
a
great
distance
,
or
from
under
the
earth
,
crying
out
strange
words
.
It
looks
like
a
tomb
,
’
muttered
Frodo
,
and
bent
forwards
with
a
curious
sense
of
foreboding
,
to
look
more
closely
at
it
.
But
why
,
if
it
were
with
us
?
’
Were
you
not
at
the
Council
?
’
answered
Frodo
.
He
only
wept
and
called
us
cruel
,
with
many
a
gollum
in
his
throat
;
and
when
we
pressed
him
he
whined
and
cringed
,
and
rubbed
his
long
hands
,
licking
his
fingers
as
if
they
pained
him
,
as
if
he
remembered
some
old
torture
.
Right
between
the
shadow
of
the
trees
there
was
a
smooth
space
,
and
over
this
he
passed
his
hands
to
and
fro
,
muttering
words
under
his
breath
.
The
task
of
hunting
out
the
last
remnant
of
the
ruffians
was
left
to
Merry
and
Pippin
,
and
it
was
soon
done
.
Whoa
,
Sam
Gamgee
!
’
he
said
aloud
.
But
not
too
quick
now
.
This
way
and
that
turned
the
dark
head
helmed
and
crowned
with
fear
,
sweeping
the
shadows
with
its
unseen
eyes
.
But
I
was
talking
nonsense
.
Down
in
a
clearing
in
the
woods
not
far
below
.
And
no
one
was
ill
,
and
everyone
was
pleased
.
There
are
five
behind
us
,
and
when
they
find
your
trail
upon
the
Road
they
will
ride
after
us
like
the
wind
.
You
have
shown
your
usual
cunning
in
getting
up
just
in
time
for
a
meal
.
There
was
a
long
silence
.
But
when
they
had
drunk
she
commanded
them
to
sit
again
on
the
grass
,
and
chairs
were
set
for
her
and
for
Celeborn
.
But
then
he
turned
aside
.
They
were
clad
in
cloaks
of
dark
grey
,
and
their
hoods
were
cast
now
over
helm
and
head
.
We
have
all
been
scared
,
said
Pippin
after
a
pause
,
in
which
Frodo
stared
at
the
fire
and
did
not
speak
.
Lor
bless
me
,
sir
,
but
I
do
love
tales
of
that
sort
.
They
are
made
of
the
fair
tree
_lebethron_
,
beloved
of
the
woodwrights
of
Gondor
,
and
a
virtue
has
been
set
upon
them
of
finding
and
returning
.
Lagduf
and
Muzgash
ran
through
,
but
they
were
shot
.
He
could
make
out
little
more
on
the
dark
plain
,
and
as
yet
he
neither
saw
any
hope
of
morning
,
nor
felt
any
wind
,
changed
or
unchanged
.
I
wonder
if
poor
Merry
is
much
hurt
.
What
have
you
to
say
?
’
Several
things
,
’
answered
Strider
.
I
must
rest
here
a
moment
,
even
if
all
the
orcs
ever
spawned
are
after
us
.
And
as
they
rode
rumour
came
of
war
in
the
North
.
The
others
lay
down
.
’
Give
them
this
,
’
said
Gandalf
,
searching
in
his
pack
and
drawing
out
a
leathern
flask
.
Pippin
stopped
.
You
are
worn
with
sorrow
and
much
toil
.
They
may
be
a
help
in
many
needs
.
Yet
even
so
it
was
Gondor
that
brought
about
its
own
decay
,
falling
by
degrees
into
dotage
,
and
thinking
that
the
Enemy
was
asleep
,
who
was
only
banished
not
destroyed
.
But
just
as
he
thought
his
dinner
was
caught
,
He
found
his
hands
had
hold
of
naught
.
Down
again
the
path
went
,
and
then
up
again
,
up
a
long
smooth
hillside
of
turf
,
towards
the
light
.
The
sun
on
the
hill
lop
was
now
getting
hot
.
There
was
no
hope
of
falling
out
unseen
:
Now
and
again
the
orc
driver
fell
back
and
jeered
at
them
.
Gollum
tore
himself
loose
and
backed
away
.
Then
Tom
put
the
Ring
round
the
end
of
his
little
finger
and
held
it
up
to
the
candlelight
.
He
can
ride
very
swiftly
when
need
presses
.
And
when
they
were
arrayed
they
went
to
the
great
feast
;
and
they
sat
at
the
King
s
table
with
Gandalf
,
and
King
omer
of
Rohan
,
and
the
Prince
Imrahil
and
all
the
chief
captains
;
and
there
also
were
Gimli
and
Legolas
.
Dark
faces
.
With
a
bound
the
Balrog
leaped
full
upon
the
bridge
.
Not
were
Minas
Tirith
falling
in
ruin
and
I
alone
could
save
her
,
so
,
using
the
weapon
of
the
Dark
Lord
for
her
good
and
my
glory
.
secrets
are
lost
.
But
I
did
not
keep
the
arrow
,
for
we
had
much
to
do
.
Light
was
growing
behind
them
.
In
fact
he
offered
to
once
,
just
before
the
party
.
The
Shire
hobbits
referred
to
those
of
Bree
,
and
to
any
others
that
lived
beyond
the
borders
,
as
Outsiders
,
and
took
very
little
interest
in
them
,
considering
them
dull
and
uncouth
.
He
looked
at
his
master
anxiously
,
and
he
took
his
hand
.
Then
Elrond
removed
a
splinter
.
Then
they
scattered
and
vanished
.
The
only
thing
that
he
did
as
Deputy
Mayor
was
to
reduce
the
Shirriffs
to
their
proper
functions
and
numbers
.
When
day
came
at
last
the
hobbits
were
surprised
to
see
how
much
closer
the
ominous
mountains
had
already
drawn
.
The
next
day
the
country
on
either
side
began
to
change
rapidly
.
Peril
comes
in
the
night
when
least
expected
,
he
said
.
Long
after
,
but
still
very
long
ago
,
there
lived
by
the
banks
of
the
Great
River
on
the
edge
of
Wilderland
a
clever
handed
and
quiet
footed
little
people
.
Then
he
returned
to
the
brink
of
the
dell
and
looked
down
at
the
others
laughing
and
talking
.
Sm
agol
has
talked
to
Orcs
,
yes
of
course
,
before
he
met
master
,
and
to
many
peoples
:
he
has
walked
very
far
.
I
must
go
home
.
Their
hearts
were
rejoiced
to
see
the
light
of
the
fire
.
I
do
not
know
to
what
company
you
will
be
assigned
;
or
the
Lord
may
hold
you
at
his
own
command
.
Not
far
away
the
voices
of
the
Entmoot
could
be
heard
still
going
on
;
but
now
they
seemed
deeper
and
less
leisurely
,
and
every
now
and
again
one
great
voice
would
rise
in
a
high
and
quickening
music
,
while
all
the
others
died
away
.
Well
,
here
we
are
and
all
ready
,
said
Merry
;
but
where
are
the
Doors
?
I
can
t
see
any
sign
of
them
.
May
the
Shire
live
for
ever
unwithered
!
And
kissing
Merry
he
went
out
,
and
Gandalf
went
with
him
.
They
stood
silent
,
reluctant
to
make
the
final
parting
,
and
only
slowly
became
aware
that
Tom
was
wishing
them
farewell
,
and
telling
them
to
have
good
heart
and
to
ride
on
till
dark
without
halting
.
Yet
I
envy
you
that
have
spoken
with
the
White
Lady
.
His
footsteps
retreated
down
the
passage
.
For
I
am
Saruman
the
Wise
,
Saruman
Ring
maker
,
Saruman
of
Many
Colours
!
I
looked
then
and
saw
that
his
robes
,
which
had
seemed
white
,
were
not
so
,
but
were
woven
of
all
colours
,
and
if
he
moved
they
shimmered
and
changed
hue
so
that
the
eye
was
bewildered
.
Oh
yes
,
nice
Master
,
nice
Sm
agol
!
Frodo
and
Sam
did
not
answer
.
You
cannot
count
on
it
a
second
time
.
The
dragon
passed
like
an
express
train
,
turned
a
somersault
,
and
burst
over
Bywater
with
a
deafening
explosion
.
It
was
answered
;
and
to
the
dismay
of
Frodo
and
his
friends
out
from
the
trees
and
rocks
away
on
the
left
four
other
Riders
came
flying
.
I
,
we
can
t
find
it
,
_gollum_
,
_gollum_
,
no
,
nowhere
.
Where
are
our
own
folk
?
It
drew
now
to
evening
by
the
hour
,
and
the
light
was
so
dim
that
even
far
sighted
men
upon
the
Citadel
could
discern
little
clearly
out
upon
the
fields
,
save
only
the
burnings
that
ever
multiplied
,
and
the
lines
of
fire
that
grew
in
length
and
speed
.
His
face
was
long
,
with
a
high
forehead
,
he
had
deep
darkling
eyes
,
hard
to
fathom
,
though
the
look
that
they
now
bore
was
grave
and
benevolent
,
and
a
little
weary
.
Which
way
should
he
choose
?
And
if
both
led
to
terror
and
death
,
what
good
lay
in
choice
?
The
day
drew
on
.
Our
days
have
darkened
,
and
we
have
dwindled
;
but
ever
the
Sword
has
passed
to
a
new
keeper
.
Do
not
then
stumble
at
the
end
of
the
road
,
answered
Gandalf
.
Go
!
You
have
yet
time
to
clean
the
rust
from
your
sword
.
His
hold
on
Sam
s
mouth
slipped
,
and
Sam
ducked
and
lunged
forward
again
,
trying
to
tear
away
from
the
grip
on
his
neck
.
But
only
a
few
trials
,
I
think
,
will
be
needed
;
and
I
shall
not
have
to
call
on
Gimli
for
words
of
the
secret
dwarf
tongue
that
they
teach
to
none
.
At
least
they
will
not
love
the
Orcs
.
If
all
the
grievances
that
stand
between
Elves
and
Dwarves
are
to
be
brought
up
here
,
we
may
as
well
abandon
this
Council
.
I
brought
a
little
hatchet
for
chopping
firewood
,
’
said
Frodo
.
It
would
bring
the
name
of
Baggins
to
their
minds
,
especially
if
there
had
been
inquiries
in
Bree
after
that
name
.
Ugl
k
was
shouting
.
That
name
the
hobbits
only
knew
in
legends
of
the
dark
past
,
like
a
shadow
in
the
background
of
their
memories
;
but
it
was
ominous
and
disquieting
.
They
had
marched
as
far
as
the
hobbits
could
endure
without
a
rest
,
and
all
were
thinking
of
a
place
where
they
could
sleep
,
when
suddenly
the
walls
to
right
and
left
van
ished
.
The
horses
were
uneasy
.
I
m
not
sure
of
it
,
he
said
to
himself
,
and
why
should
I
remind
them
of
the
old
villain
,
if
they
choose
to
forget
him
?
I
wish
I
could
!
So
they
passed
on
,
until
the
woodlands
grew
thinner
and
the
land
began
to
fall
more
steeply
.
I
will
come
with
you
.
He
believes
that
the
horsemen
slew
and
burned
all
upon
the
field
of
battle
;
but
he
does
not
know
whether
the
Orcs
were
bringing
any
prisoners
or
not
.
Away
to
the
left
something
glittered
in
the
gloom
as
Aragorn
s
torch
drew
near
.
Out
of
it
came
a
stench
,
not
the
sickly
odour
of
decay
in
the
meads
of
Morgul
,
but
a
foul
reek
,
as
if
filth
unnameable
were
piled
and
hoarded
in
the
dark
within
.
Wild
Men
live
here
before
Stone
houses
;
before
Tall
Men
come
up
out
of
Water
.
Well
,
thought
I
,
if
they
re
such
fools
,
I
will
get
ahead
of
them
and
teach
them
a
lesson
.
He
let
out
a
loud
sigh
and
gave
a
huge
yawn
.
Fissh
,
nice
fissh
:
Makes
us
strong
.
There
he
was
calmly
sitting
in
a
chair
by
the
door
!
Hallo
!
’
said
Pippin
.
Wise
man
trusts
not
to
chance
meeting
on
the
road
in
this
land
.
But
I
missed
a
lot
,
seemingly
.
But
you
can
t
get
much
hope
out
of
it
.
’
Short
cuts
make
long
delays
,
’
argued
Pippin
.
At
dusk
the
Company
set
out
,
and
turning
now
half
east
they
steered
their
course
towards
Caradhras
,
which
far
away
still
glowed
faintly
red
in
the
last
light
of
the
vanished
Sun
.
We
left
Hobbiton
secretly
enough
,
and
I
don’t
see
how
he
could
have
followed
us
.
Hugo
was
a
great
borrower
of
books
,
and
worse
than
usual
at
returning
them
.
Four
only
were
saved
by
swimming
:
my
brother
and
myself
and
two
others
.
When
they
had
walked
for
about
three
hours
they
rested
.
I
only
said
I
think
I
shall
come
.
But
do
not
stray
far
or
out
of
call
.
The
man
stared
after
the
hobbits
for
a
moment
,
and
then
he
went
back
to
his
house
.
The
obvious
thing
to
do
,
of
course
,
if
one
could
.
But
you
will
first
surrender
to
me
the
Key
of
Orthanc
,
and
your
staff
.
To
my
home
,
or
one
of
my
homes
,
answered
Treebeard
.
Now
you
speak
to
yourself
again
,
said
Aragorn
with
a
smile
.
Many
tall
men
heavily
cloaked
stood
beside
him
,
and
behind
them
in
the
mist
loomed
a
wall
of
stone
.
It
will
be
drier
above
,
said
Gimli
.
Frodo
was
sitting
at
a
table
with
a
lot
of
papers
in
front
of
him
.
Uncanny
,
I
called
it
.
Come
on
!
Follow
me
!
’
he
called
back
over
his
shoulder
,
and
he
hurried
forward
.
Merry
led
the
pony
over
a
gangway
on
to
the
ferry
,
and
the
others
followed
.
Calling
me
early
aren
t
you
,
Sam
?
he
said
.
I
am
Mr.
Brandybuck
.
At
length
a
silence
fell
,
and
they
heard
the
music
of
the
waterfall
running
sweetly
in
the
shadows
.
You
are
kindly
hosts
!
’
All
the
same
,
we
bid
you
spare
the
food
,
’
they
said
.
And
when
they
sat
at
supper
with
her
,
they
talked
together
,
and
she
heard
of
all
that
had
passed
since
Th
oden
rode
away
,
concerning
which
only
hasty
tidings
had
yet
reached
her
;
and
when
she
heard
of
the
battle
in
Helm
s
Deep
and
the
great
slaughter
of
their
foes
,
and
of
the
charge
of
Th
oden
and
his
knights
,
then
her
eyes
shone
.
I
am
Mr.
Underhill
,
if
any
name
must
be
given
.
I
don
t
,
said
Gandalf
grimly
.
It
was
hard
to
say
of
what
colour
they
were
:
grey
with
the
hue
of
twilight
under
the
trees
they
seemed
to
be
;
and
yet
if
they
were
moved
,
or
set
in
another
light
,
they
were
green
as
shadowed
leaves
,
or
brown
as
fallow
fields
by
night
,
dusk
silver
as
water
under
the
stars
.
In
vain
men
shook
their
fists
at
the
pitiless
foes
that
swarmed
before
the
Gate
.
No
time
to
lose
!
Sam
stared
at
him
suspiciously
:
he
seemed
frightened
or
excited
.
Sam
!
he
called
.
See
!
Though
all
is
now
snow
clad
,
our
path
,
as
we
came
up
,
turned
about
that
shoulder
of
rock
down
yonder
.
Then
all
at
once
there
was
a
tremendous
stir
.
Soon
after
six
o
clock
the
five
hobbits
were
ready
to
start
.
They
walked
slowly
,
stooping
,
keeping
close
in
line
,
following
attentively
every
move
that
Gollum
made
.
Perhaps
so
,
said
Aragorn
.
If
the
giving
of
information
is
to
be
the
cure
of
your
inquisitiveness
,
I
shall
spend
all
the
rest
of
my
days
in
answering
you
.
Now
!
said
Gimli
.
Gimli
was
wandering
about
,
tapping
the
stone
here
and
there
with
his
axe
.
No
peace
shall
I
have
again
under
beech
or
under
elm
.
It
was
after
nightfall
when
they
had
entered
the
Mines
.
If
you
weren
t
hobbits
,
I
doubt
if
we
could
house
you
.
If
the
Emyn
Muil
lie
before
us
,
then
we
can
abandon
these
cockle
boats
,
and
strike
westward
and
southward
,
until
we
come
to
the
Entwash
and
cross
into
my
own
land
.
There
will
always
be
some
folk
,
big
or
little
,
and
even
a
few
wise
dwarves
like
Gimli
,
who
need
you
.
Two
of
them
had
already
fallen
to
his
sword
,
staining
the
hallows
with
their
blood
;
and
the
others
cursed
him
,
calling
him
outlaw
and
traitor
to
his
master
.
It
s
from
Hobbiton
that
this
here
black
rider
comes
,
unless
there
s
more
than
one
.
Still
,
I
take
more
kindly
to
Elves
than
to
others
:
it
was
the
Elves
that
cured
us
of
dumbness
long
ago
,
and
that
was
a
great
gift
that
cannot
be
forgotten
,
though
our
ways
have
parted
since
.
’
But
I
say
it
now
.
Again
she
fled
,
but
swift
he
came
.
Sam
!
he
called
.
I
can
hear
a
pony
or
a
horse
coming
along
the
road
behind
,
said
Sam
.
It
was
night
.
The
four
younger
hobbits
were
,
however
,
in
high
spirits
,
and
the
party
soon
became
very
cheerful
in
spite
of
Gandalf
s
absence
.
And
the
music
and
the
singing
not
that
I
have
had
the
time
or
the
heart
for
much
listening
since
we
got
here
.
Then
he
drank
deeply
,
refilled
the
bottle
,
and
turned
to
go
back
.
’
Then
all
listened
while
Elrond
in
his
clear
voice
spoke
of
Sauron
and
the
Rings
of
Power
,
and
their
forging
in
the
Second
Age
of
the
world
long
ago
.
Driven
by
some
impulse
that
he
did
not
understand
,
Pippin
walked
softly
to
where
Gandalf
lay
.
As
the
third
day
of
their
voyage
wore
on
the
lands
changed
slowly
:
the
trees
thinned
and
then
failed
altogether
.
And
they
passed
him
by
.
Do
not
approach
their
citadel
.
No
trees
grew
there
and
it
was
open
to
the
sky
;
stars
were
shining
already
in
lakes
between
shores
of
cloud
.
No
,
not
this
Baggins
.
They
were
climbing
steadily
.
I
wish
to
find
him
.
Alas
!
My
old
age
is
not
feigned
nor
due
only
to
the
whisperings
of
Wormtongue
.
Many
of
them
had
indeed
been
ordered
a
year
before
,
and
had
come
all
the
way
from
the
Mountain
and
from
Dale
,
and
were
of
real
dwarf
make
.
They
were
carved
like
boles
of
mighty
trees
whose
boughs
upheld
the
roof
with
a
branching
tracery
of
stone
.
But
that
no
longer
troubles
him
