’
Yes 
,
long
and
weary
,
’
said
Gandalf	B-PER
,
but
not
without
profit
.
There
are
columns
of
white
and
saffron
and
dawn
rose
,
Legolas	B-PER
,
fluted
and
twisted
into
dreamlike
forms
;
they
spring
up
from
many
coloured
floors
to
meet
the
glistening
pendants
of
the
roof
:
wings
,
ropes
,
curtains
fine
as
frozen
clouds
;
spears
,
banners
,
pinnacles
of
suspended
palaces
!
Still
lakes
mirror
them
:
a
glimmering
world
looks
up
from
dark
pools
covered
with
clear
glass
;
cities
.
He
stretched
himself
upon
the
ground
with
his
ear
pressed
against
the
turf
.
His
sword
was
long
,
his
lance
was
keen
,
his
shining
helm
afar
was
seen
;
the
countless
stars
of
heaven
s
field
were
mirrored
in
his
silver
shield
.
Yes
,
we
certainly
must
decide
what
to
do
at
once
,
answered
Strider	B-PER
,
looking
up
and
considering
the
time
and
the
weather
.
Regiments
of
black
crows
are
flying
over
all
the
land
between
the
Mountains	B-LOC
and
the
Greyflood	B-LOC
,
he
said
,
and
they
have
passed
over
Hollin	B-LOC
.
Then
at
last
his
gaze
was
held
:
wall
upon
wall
,
battlement
upon
battlement
,
black
,
immeasurably
strong
,
mountain
of
iron
,
gate
of
steel
,
tower
of
adamant
,
he
saw
it
:
Baraddr	B-LOC
,
Fortress	B-LOC
of	B-LOC
Sauron	B-LOC
.
Smagol	B-LOC
is
not
pleased
.
The
Lord	B-PER
is
out
of
his
mind
,
I
think
.
You
must
make
up
your
mind
.
The
victor
would
emerge
stronger
than
either
,
and
free
from
doubt
,
said
Gandalf	B-PER
.
Let
us
gird
ourselves
and
weep
no
more
!
Come
!
We
have
a
long
road
,
and
much
to
do
.
You
will
be
glad
to
have
them
back
.
Have
hope
!
’
said
Boromir	B-PER
.
Merry	B-PER
and
Pippin	B-PER
climbed
the
gate
,
and
the
hobbits
fled
.
But
not
here
or
now
.
(
Otho	B-PER
had
died
some
years
before
,
at
the
ripe
but
disappointed
age
of
102
.
My
lad
,
said
Troll
,
this
bone
I
stole
.
As
they
rode
forward
the
day
was
overcast
.
Now
for
the
last
race
!
said
Gandalf	B-PER
.
And
listen
,
Gandalf	B-PER
,
my
old
friend
and
helper
!
he
said
,
coming
near
and
speaking
now
in
a
softer
voice
.
The
Dwarves
have
a
name
which
they
do
not
tell
.
’
He
said
it
?
And
who
was
he
?
’
asked
Frodo	B-PER
eagerly
.
Not
for
long
now
,
said
Gandalf	B-PER
.
He
took
his
own
tea
with
Pippin	B-PER
and
Sam	B-PER
Gamgee	I-PER
in
the
kitchen
.
Hope
is
not
victory
.
’
Indeed
it
would
take
away
the
only
point
I
ever
saw
in
the
affair
,
’
said
Gandalf	B-PER
.
At
their
first
halt
they
looked
back
,
and
they
could
dimly
perceive
the
roofs
of
the
forest
they
had
left
behind
lying
like
a
vast
dense
shadow
,
a
darker
night
under
the
dark
blank
sky
.
What
s
to
be
done
?
Have
those
eyes
come
back
?
No
,
not
to
be
seen
,
said
Frodo	B-PER
.
I
ll
just
plod
along
after
you
.
Farmer
Cotton	B-PER
looked
at
him
slowly
.
The
hobbits
looked
anxiously
at
the
distant
hills
.
Then
for
a
while
hope
left
me
,
and
I
did
not
wait
to
gather
news
,
or
I
might
have
been
comforted
;
but
I
rode
on
the
trail
of
the
Riders
.
It
was
dark
save
for
an
occasional
torch
flaring
at
a
turn
,
or
beside
some
opening
that
led
into
the
higher
levels
of
the
Tower	B-LOC
.
They
will
drive
these
wretches
to
some
evil
work
:
Ferny	B-PER
,
and
some
of
the
strangers
,
and
,
maybe
,
the
gatekeeper
too
.
We
come
to
teach
them
another
lesson
.
They
were
only
half
way
across
the
flat
,
when
suddenly
there
was
a
noise
of
horses
galloping
.
It
is
mine
,
I
tell
you
.
Hobbits
?
said
Théoden	B-PER
.
Go
on
now
!
But
take
care
of
yourself
,
and
come
straight
back
as
soon
as
you
have
settled
the
ruffians
!
When
Sam	B-PER
got
back
he
found
the
whole
village
roused
.
Time
flows
on
to
a
spring
of
little
hope
.
None
at
all
,
’
he
said
.
Frodo	B-PER
peering
forward
saw
in
the
distance
two
great
rocks
approaching
:
like
great
pinnacles
or
pillars
of
stone
they
seemed
.
But
as
they
went
the
most
easterly
of
the
roads
followed
them
,
until
it
ran
off
,
hugging
the
skirts
of
the
mountains
,
away
into
a
wall
of
black
shadow
far
ahead
.
The
two
guards
were
not
in
view
:
they
were
up
on
the
hill
,
perhaps
,
or
hidden
in
the
bracken
.
It
was
a
misty
,
moisty
morning
when
we
climbed
down
and
looked
round
again
,
and
nobody
was
about
.
And
now
I
think
I’ll
be
getting
to
bed
.
Great
deed
was
the
riding
of
the
Paths	B-LOC
of	I-LOC
the	I-LOC
Dead	I-LOC
,
and
great
it
shall
remain
,
though
none
be
left
in
Gondor	B-LOC
to
sing
of
it
in
the
days
that
are
to
come
.
The
feast
was
merry
and
the
food
all
that
his
hunger
could
desire
.
But
something
held
him
back
.
I
hope
that
you
ll
not
take
it
amiss
.
If
that
isn
t
the
very
tree
you
hid
behind
when
the
Black	B-PER
Rider	I-PER
first
showed
up
,
Mr.
Frodo	B-PER
!
said
Sam	B-PER
pointing
to
the
left
.
The
worthies
of
Bree	B-LOC
will
be
dis
cussing
it
a
hundred
years
hence
.
Nay
,
there
was
no
change
of
counsel
,
said
the
Lady
Galadriel	B-PER
speaking
for
the
first
time
.
He
was
covered
with
green
slime
.
Sméagol	B-PER
will
swear
never
,
never
,
to
let
Him
have
it
.
It
is
not
my
will
,
he
said
,
to
put
aside
my
sword
or
to
deliver
And
ril
to
the
hand
of
any
other
man
.
He
felt
that
black
shapes
were
advancing
to
smother
him
;
but
when
he
sat
up
he
saw
nothing
but
the
back
of
Strider	B-PER
sitting
hunched
up
,
smoking
his
pipe
,
and
watching
.
This
is
Sting
.
It
was
not
bird
or
beast
,
said
Frodo	B-PER
.
They
have
no
need
to
ride
to
war
;
war
already
marches
on
their
own
lands
.
Then
we
are
all
men
here
.
Now
tell
me
all
about
it
!
I
guess
that
you
have
been
having
adventures
,
which
was
not
quite
fair
without
me
.
He
searched
the
wound
on
Frodo	B-PER
s
shoulder
with
his
fingers
,
and
his
face
grew
graver
,
as
if
what
he
learned
disquieted
him
.
Frar	B-PER
and
Loni	B-PER
and
Nali	B-PER
fell
there
.
All
that
Frodo	B-PER
and
Sam	B-PER
knew
of
this
last
mile
of
the
road
they
learned
from
guessing
in
the
dark
.
I
am
going
to
have
a
long
talk
with
Bombadil	B-PER
:
such
a
talk
as
I
have
not
had
in
all
my
time
.
What
had
come
over
them
?
Why
had
they
dashed
off
like
that
,
taking
no
notice
of
old
Strider	B-PER
?
They
had
run
a
long
way
shouting
he
could
not
remember
how
far
or
how
long
;
and
then
suddenly
they
had
crashed
right
into
a
group
of
Orcs
:
they
were
standing
listening
,
and
they
did
not
appear
to
see
Merry	B-PER
and
Pippin	B-PER
until
they
were
almost
in
their
arms
.
It
is
wretched
for
us
all
,
but
it
is
no
use
your
trying
to
keep
me
.
Every
now
and
again
they
caught
,
among
many
a
_derry
dol_
and
a
_merry
dol_
and
a
_ring
a
ding
dillo_
the
repeated
words
:
Old
Tom	B-PER
Bombadil	I-PER
is
a
merry
fellow
;
Bright
blue
his
jacket
is
,
and
his
boots
are
yellow
.
Fly
,
if
you
value
your
foul
skin
!
I
will
shrivel
you
from
tail
to
snout
,
if
you
come
within
this
ring
.
Frodo	B-PER
!
Mr.
Frodo	B-PER
,
my
dear
!
cried
Sam	B-PER
,
tears
almost
blinding
him
.
Tell
us
of
Gil-galad	B-LOC
,
said
Merry	B-PER
suddenly
,
when
he
paused
at
the
end
of
a
story
of
the
Elf	B-LOC
Kingdoms	I-LOC
.
Dangerous
indeed
,
but
not
to
all
,
said
Aragorn	B-PER
.
When
Frodo	B-PER
was
asleep
Sam	B-PER
bent
over
him
and
listened
to
his
breathing
and
scanned
his
face
.
And
those
that
watched
felt
that
some
great
struggle
was
going
on
.
I
will
send
out
messages
,
such
as
I
can
contrive
,
to
those
whom
I
know
in
the
wide
world
;
but
so
perilous
are
the
lands
now
become
that
some
may
well
mis
carry
,
or
come
no
quicker
than
you
yourself
.
Ahead
there
loomed
now
against
the
dusky
sky
the
bleak
and
treeless
backs
of
the
hills
.
We
are
all
friends
here
.
Both
father
and
son
were
on
very
friendly
terms
with
Bilbo	B-PER
and
Frodo	B-PER
.
The
trees
were
the
worst
loss
and
damage
,
for
at
Sharkey	B-PER
s
bidding
they
had
been
cut
down
recklessly
far
and
wide
over
the
Shire	B-LOC
;
and
Sam	B-PER
grieved
over
this
more
than
anything
else
.
He
thrust
and
pushed
at
the
block
,
and
he
threw
himself
against
it
,
but
it
did
not
yield
.
Are
you
going
any
further
?
Yes
,
I
am
.
What
?
_Me_
take
the
Ring
from
_him_
?
The
Council	B-ORG
gave
it
to
him
.
The
drink
in
their
drinking
bowls
seemed
to
be
clear
cold
water
,
yet
it
went
to
their
hearts
like
wine
and
set
free
their
voices
.
Shadows
rose
behind
and
reached
out
long
arms
from
the
East
.
Then
I
was
weary
,
very
weary
;
and
I
walked
long
in
dark
thought
.
Frodo	B-PER
coming
behind
grabbed
his
leg
and
threw
him
.
Overcome
with
weakness
he
wept
.
He
s
over
there
,
he
cackled
.
O
yes
indeed
there
is
.
Is
that
enough
for
you
?
The
Bree	B-LOC
folk
used
to
be
fair
spoken
to
travellers
,
or
so
I
had
heard
.
There
is
a
dry
fir
wood
just
ahead
,
if
I
remember
rightly
.
Fire
shall
devour
the
high
seat
.
Then
he
and
Frodo	B-PER
went
off
with
Farmer
Cotton	B-PER
.
Whither
do
you
run
,
Master
Peregrin	B-PER
?
he
cried
.
I
think
you
look
fine
,
Sam	B-PER
,
she
said
.
I
can
only
suppose
that
he
had
seen
Gandalf	B-PER
or
had
some
news
of
him
,
but
would
not
say
anything
in
a
hurry
.
He
straddled
one
of
these
,
and
paddled
his
hot
feet
in
the
cool
brown
water
;
and
there
he
too
suddenly
fell
asleep
with
his
back
against
the
tree
.
Of
course
he’s
had
a
bit
of
schooling
,
so
to
speak
we
all
have
since
we
left
home
,
or
he’d
be
so
terrified
he’d
just
fling
the
Ring
in
the
River
and
bolt
.
I
have
been
so
taken
up
with
the
thoughts
of
leaving
Bag	B-LOC
End	I-LOC
,
and
of
saying
farewell
,
that
I
have
never
even
considered
the
direction
,
said
Frodo	B-PER
.
I
told
Bilbo	B-PER
often
that
such
rings
were
better
left
unused
;
but
he
resented
it
,
and
soon
got
angry
.
I
know
we
are
going
to
take
a
very
long
road
,
into
darkness
;
but
I
know
I
can
t
turn
back
.
Thither
,
eastward
,
unwilling
his
eye
was
drawn
.
But
he
s
got
you
,
you
nassty
filthy
little
sneak
!
He
spat
on
Sam	B-PER
s
neck
.
Sam	B-PER
stepped
back
and
braced
his
feet
against
a
stump
a
yard
or
two
from
the
edge
.
Every
now
and
again
a
tiny
red
gleam
far
away
flickered
upwards
on
the
rim
of
earth
and
sky
.
A
few
miles
to
the
north
east
the
foothills
of
the
Ashen	B-LOC
Mountains	I-LOC
stood
like
sombre
grey
ghosts
,
behind
which
the
misty
northern
heights
rose
like
a
line
of
distant
cloud
hardly
darker
than
the
lowering
sky
.
From
inside
the
hood
came
a
noise
as
of
someone
sniffing
to
catch
an
elusive
scent
;
the
head
turned
from
side
to
side
of
the
road
.
Curse
him
!
No
sooner
had
he
slipped
us
and
run
off
than
word
came
he
s
wanted
alive
,
wanted
quick
.
And
they
became
our
allies
,
and
have
ever
proved
true
to
us
,
aiding
us
at
need
,
and
guarding
our
northern
marches
and
the
Gap	B-LOC
of	B-LOC
Rohan	B-LOC
.
The
Ring
is
another
:
you
are
the
Ring
bearer
.
Yet
we
are
hard
pressed
,
and
the
Sword
of
Elendil	B-PER
would
be
a
help
beyond
our
hope
if
such
a
thing
could
indeed
return
out
of
the
shadows
of
the
past
.
The
night
was
old
and
the
East
grey
when
they
rode
up
at
last
from
Deeping-coomb	B-LOC
and
came
back
to
the
Hornburg	B-LOC
.
He
used
to
tell
me
tales
like
that
,
knowing
how
I
was
always
one
for
hearing
about
Elves
.
I
think
that
the
enemy
brought
his
own
enemy
with
him
,
answered
Aragorn	B-PER
.
For
here
the
heirs
of
Valandil	B-PER
have
ever
dwelt
in
long
line
unbroken
from
father
unto
son
for
many
generations
.
Even
when
the
paddles
were
in
use
they
did
not
trust
Sam	B-PER
with
one
.
Good
evening
,
little
master
!
he
said
,
bending
down
.
Then
once
more
,
orc
fashion
,
he
leapt
aside
,
and
as
Sam	B-PER
sprang
at
him
,
using
the
heavy
bundle
as
both
shield
and
weapon
,
he
thrust
it
hard
into
his
enemy
s
face
.
Yet
you
speak
the
truth
,
that
is
plain
:
the
Men	B-ORG
of	I-ORG
the	I-ORG
Mark	I-ORG
do
not
lie
,
and
therefore
they
are
not
easily
deceived
.
You
swore
a
promise
by
what
you
call
the
Precious
.
On
the
third
morning
Caradhras	B-PER
rose
before
them
,
a
mighty
peak
,
tipped
with
snow
like
silver
,
but
with
sheer
naked
sides
,
dull
red
as
if
stained
with
blood
.
They
had
no
fuel
nor
any
means
of
malting
torches
;
in
the
desperate
scramble
at
the
doors
many
things
had
been
left
behind
.
But
the
day
has
brought
strange
tidings
.
There
was
a
cold
gleam
in
it
.
Your
leechcraft
ere
long
would
have
had
me
walking
on
all
fours
like
a
beast
.
At
the
end
of
June
I
was
in
the
Shire	B-LOC
,
but
a
cloud
of
anxiety
was
on
my
mind
,
and
I
rode
to
the
southern
borders
of
the
little
land
;
for
I
had
a
foreboding
of
some
danger
,
still
hidden
from
me
but
drawing
near
.
Elrond	B-PER
and
Arwen	B-PER
rose
and
went
down
the
hall
,
and
the
company
followed
them
in
due
order
.
Travellers
scowl
at
us
,
and
countrymen
give
us
scornful
names
.
Still
we
feel
less
ill
disposed
towards
Saruman	B-PER
than
we
did
.
When
they
came
to
the
corner
they
looked
round
and
saw
that
the
path
ran
on
over
a
level
strip
under
the
face
of
a
low
cliff
overhung
with
trees
.
Anyway
,
this
is
what
happened
.
Who
comes
hither
to
disturb
the
rest
of
Balin	B-PER	
Lord
of
Moria
?
he
cried
in
a
loud
voice
.
But
say
to
Denethor	B-PER
that
even
if
Rohan	B-LOC
itself
felt
no
peril
,
still
we
would
come
to
his
aid
.
Gandalf	B-PER
was
gazing
up
,
his
arms
out
and
downwards
,
stiff
,
his
hands
clenched
.
At
first
they
could
see
nothing
.
And
begging
yours
,
Sam	B-PER
Gamgee	I-PER
,
replied
Bilbo	B-PER
.
I
don’t
know
how
to
say
it
,
but
after
last
night
I
feel
different
.
I
do
not
know
,
’
Strider	B-PER
answered
.
Frodo	B-PER		
waited
patiently
for
a
while
,
then
he
spoke
again
less
sternly
.
The
sun
was
not
,
however
,
high
enough
yet
to
shine
down
into
the
clearing
,
though
its
light
was
on
the
tree
tops
.
I
could
not
make
out
what
they
were
about
.
I
hardly
feel
that
I
have
moved
at
all
.
He
has
long
studied
it
,
seeking
the
lost
secrets
of
their
making
;
but
when
the
Rings
were
debated
in
the
Council	B-ORG
,
all
that
he
would
reveal
to
us
of
his
ring
lore
told
against
my
fears
.
Take
courage
and
look
!
There
are
fell
things
below
.
He
knows
or
guesses
something
about
it
.
The
biter
bit
,
the
hawk
under
the
eagle
s
foot
,
the
spider
in
a
steel
web
!
How
long
,
I
wonder
,
has
he
been
constrained
to
come
often
to
his
glass
for
inspection
and
instruction
,
and
the
Orthanc
stone
so
bent
towards
Baraddr B-LOC
that
,
if
any
save
a
will
of
adamant
now
looks
into
it
,
it
will
bear
his
mind
and
sight
swiftly
thither
?
And
how
it
draws
one
to
itself
!
Have
I
not
felt
it
?
Even
now
my
heart
desires
to
test
my
will
upon
it
,
to
see
if
I
could
not
wrench
it
from
him
and
turn
it
where
I
would
to
look
across
the
wide
seas
of
water
and
of
time
to
Tirion	B-LOC
the	B-LOC
Fair	B-LOC
,
and
perceive
the
unimaginable
hand
and
mind
of
Fëanor	B-PER
at
their
work
,
while
both
the
White
Tree
and
the
Golden
were
in
flower
!
He
sighed
and
fell
silent
.
You
shall
sit
beside
me
,
as
long
as
I
remain
in
my
own
lands
,
and
lighten
my
heart
with
tales
.
It
s
a
long
time
,
Mr.
Frodo	B-PER
,
since
I
had
a
proper
sleep
,
and
my
eyes
just
closed
down
on
their
own
.
They
came
at
last
to
a
white
bridge
,
and
crossing
found
the
great
gates
of
the
city
:
they
faced
south
west
,
set
between
the
ends
of
the
encircling
wall
that
here
overlapped
,
and
they
were
tall
and
strong
,
and
hung
with
many
lamps
.
The
roads
are
cut
.
Three
cheers
for
Captain
Frodo	B-PER
and
company
!
’
they
shouted
;
and
they
danced
round
him
.
Now
Denethor	B-PER
stood
up
and
released
the
fevered
hand
of
Faramir	B-PER
that
he
had
held
.
Find
only
news
of
the
thief
,
whether
he
still
lives
and
where
,
and
you
shall
have
great
reward
and
lasting
friendship
from
the
Lord
.
He
half
expected
to
see
Gandalf	B-PER
come
striding
up
through
the
dusk
.
Let
us
leave
them
!
They
returned
now
to
the
ruins
of
the
gate
.
Valour
in
arms
is
yours
,
and
you
win
high
honour
thereby
.
Heaving
up
again
,
wrenching
away
from
the
pain
,
she
bent
her
writhing
limbs
beneath
her
and
sprang
backwards
in
a
convulsive
leap
.
The
Sackville	B-PER
Bagginses	I-PER
were
rather
offensive
.
Sam	B-PER
turned
away
and
sighed
:
I
wish
I
was
going
back
to
Lorien	B-LOC
!
At
last
one
evening
they
came
over
the
high
moors
,
suddenly
as
to
travellers
it
always
seemed
,
to
the
brink
of
the
deep
valley
of
Rivendell	B-LOC
and
saw
far
below
the
lamps
shining
in
Elrond	B-PER
s
house
.
A
part
of
his
tale
was
known
to
some
there
,
but
the
full
tale
to
none
,
and
many
eyes
were
turned
t
Elrond	B-PER
in
fear
and
wonder
as
he
told
of
the
Elven
smiths
of
Eregion	B-LOC
and
their
friendship
with
Moria	B-LOC
,
and
their
eagerness
for
knowledge
,
by
which
Sauron	B-PER
ensnared
them
.
The
old
man
took
no
notice
,
but
stooped
and
sat
himself
on
a
low
flat
stone
.
There
is
a
wholesome
air
about
Hollin	B-PER
.
He
thought
as
little
as
possible
about
the
Ring
,
and
where
it
might
lead
him
in
the
end
.
The
world
is
indeed
full
of
peril
,
and
in
it
there
are
many
dark
places
;
but
still
there
is
much
that
is
fair
,
and
though
in
all
lands
love
is
now
mingled
with
grief
,
it
grows
perhaps
the
greater
.
That
is
where
my
grandsire
lives
.
And
some
that
die
deserve
life
.
Frodo	B-PER
stopped
eating
to
look
at
him
.
Pippin	B-PER
stepped
back
hastily
.
We
were
the
hunters
,
and
you
should
give
an
account
of
yourselves
to
us
first
.
We
can
fill
it
again
when
we
go
on
.
They
came
to
a
cleft
between
two
dark
crags
,
and
passing
through
found
themselves
on
the
very
edge
of
the
last
fence
of
Mordor	B-LOC
.
Turn
!
Turn
if
you
can
!
’
He
drove
his
paddle
into
the
water
,
trying
to
hold
the
boat
and
bring
it
round
.
But
still
we
fight
on
,
holding
all
the
west
shores
of
Anduin	B-LOC
;
and
those
who
shelter
behind
us
give
us
praise
,
if
ever
they
hear
our
name
:
much
praise
but
little
help
.
We
cannot
count
on
getting
anything
to
eat
between
here
and
Rivendell	B-LOC
,
except
what
we
take
with
us
;
and
we
ought
to
take
plenty
to
spare
;
for
we
may
be
delayed
,
or
forced
to
go
round
about
,
far
out
of
the
direct
way
.
There
was
a
great
draught
of
warmer
air
behind
them
,
and
before
them
the
darkness
was
cold
on
their
faces
.
She
seemed
to
be
looking
inside
me
and
asking
me
what
I
would
do
if
she
gave
me
the
chance
of
flying
back
home
to
the
Shire	B-LOC
to
a
nice
little
hole
with
with
a
bit
of
garden
of
my
own
.
Only
for
a
short
while
,
I
hope
,
he
said
.
Look
out
!
cried
Sam	B-LOC
.
Their
eyes
met
and
they
understood
.
The
next
will
be
greater
.
Sam	B-PER
will
.
And
where
were
you
off
to
in
the
cold
hard
lands
,
Mr.
Gollum	B-PER
?
he
growled
.
If
he
comes
off
alive
,
he
should
be
your
faithful
servant
for
the
rest
of
his
unhappy
days
.
At
the
top
,
as
high
as
Gandalf	B-PER
could
reach
,
was
an
arch
of
interlacing
letters
in
an
Elvish
character
.
At
the
top
of
the
bank
the
horse
halted
and
turned
about
neighing
fiercely
.
Behind
them
walked
Legolas
and
Gimli
.
Already
the
short
afternoon
was
past
,
and
a
dim
cloudy
dusk
was
closing
in
.
The
others
go
with
him
as
free
companions
,
to
help
him
on
his
way
.
Though
other
folks
besides
hobbits
ask
riddles
,
and
of
much
the
same
sort
.
I
do
not
counsel
you
to
leave
the
City
all
unmanned
.
He
was
running
on
the
green
turf
and
singing
.
We
have
no
choice
but
to
go
on
,
or
to
return
to
Rivendell	B-LOC
.
But
long
ago
he
rode
away
,
and
where
he
dwelleth
none
can
say
;
for
into
darkness
fell
his
star
in
Mordor	B-LOC
where
the
shadows
are
.
They
lived
mostly
in
Staddle	B-LOC
though
there
were
some
in
Bree	B-LOC
itself
,
especially
on
the
higher
slopes
of
the
hill
,
above
the
houses
of
the
Men
.
I
should
very
much
like
just
to
peep
at
it
again
.
He
was
the
Lord
of
Rivendell	B-LOC
and
mighty
among
both
Elves
and
Men
.
My
lord
,
said
the
Warden
,
here
is
the
Lady
Eowyn	B-PER	
of	I-PER
Rohan	I-PER
.
Your
talk
of
sniffing
riders
with
invisible
noses
has
unsettled
me
.
Yes
,
sir
!
said
Sam	B-PER
.
For
it
has
no
virtue
that
we
know
of
,
save
perhaps
to
sweeten
a
fouled
air
,
or
to
drive
away
some
passing
heaviness
.
No
fireworks
like
poor
old
Gandalf	B-PER
used
to
show
.
We
re
not
in
decent
places
.
But
it
could
not
be
found
until
last
night
.
And
rising
he
looked
then
on
Eowyn	B-PER
and
was
amazed
.
But
Tom	B-PER
now
seemed
wide
awake
and
plied
them
with
questions
.
Wicked
!
Tricksy
!
False
!
He
spat
and
stretched
out
his
long
arms
with
white
snapping
fingers
.
They
had
words
with
Harry	B-PER
at
West
gate
on
Monday
.
It
must
have
seemed
very
hasty
to
Treebeard	B-PER
,
for
Gandalf	B-PER
was
in
a
tremendous
hurry
,
and
was
already
talking
at
a
great
pace
,
before
they
passed
out
of
hearing
.
Following
the
winding
way
up
the
green
shoulders
of
the
hills
,
they
came
at
last
to
the
wide
wind
swept
walls
and
the
gates
of
Edoras	B-loc
.
In
the
middle
there
was
a
wood
fire
blazing
,
and
upon
the
tree
pillars
torches
with
lights
of
gold
and
silver
were
burning
steadily
.
You
do
not
know
your
peril
.
At
the
top
was
a
wide
echoing
passage
.
And
you
are
the
heir
of
Bilbo	B-PER
,
the
Ring
finder
.
They
sounded
disquietingly
like
signals
of
some
sort
;
but
after
a
while
the
knocking
died
away
and
was
not
heard
again
.
Even
the
wise
cannot
see
all
ends
.
When
they
reached
the
bottom
it
was
so
chill
that
they
halted
and
got
out
cloaks
and
hoods
,
which
soon
became
bedewed
with
grey
drops
.
Did
you
ask
about
the
sniffing
?
We
didn
t
discuss
it
,
said
Frodo	B-PER
with
his
mouth
full
.
They
were
going
fast
,
with
a
light
_clippety
clippely
clip
.
He
said
something
about
going
for
a
breath
of
air
.
Mind
that
!
But
you
need
ask
no
questions
.
For
otherwise
I
shall
follow
the
Company	B-ORG
.
Command
me
,
lord
!
he
cried
.
Then
be
comforted
,
said
Elrond	B-PER
.
Wait
for
me
,
Sam	B-PER
,
he
stammered
.
Yet
the
way
of
the
Ring
to
my
heart
is
by
pity
,
pity
for
weakness
and
the
desire
of
strength
to
do
good
.
Or
maybe
not
:
fish
from
the
pool
of
Henneth	B-LOC
Annun	I-LOC
may
cost
him
all
he
has
to
give
.
The
hobbits
sat
down
gladly
in
low
rush
seated
chairs
,
while
Goldberry	B-PER
busied
herself
about
the
table
;
and
their
eyes
followed
her
,
for
the
slender
grace
of
her
movement
filled
them
with
quiet
delight
.
Thanks
to
Saruman	B-PER
:
Then
is
not
Saruman	B-PER
a
traitor
?
said
Gimli	B-PER
.
They
were
on
the
top
of
a
sloping
bank
,
and
the
Road
,
now
dim
as
evening
drew
on
,
wound
away
below
them
.
And
I
don
t
reckon
that
these
folk
can
do
much
more
to
help
us
,
magic
or
no
.
’
Following
his
lead
the
Company	B-ORG
passed
under
the
northern
arch
.
The
river
,
now
small
and
swift
,
was
leaping
merrily
down
to
meet
them
,
glinting
here
and
there
in
the
light
of
the
stars
,
which
were
already
shining
in
the
sky
.
The
light
of
sun
and
star
and
moon
In
shining
lamps
of
crystal
hewn
Undimmed
by
cloud
or
shade
of
night
There
shone
for
ever
fair
and
bright
.
He
did
not
get
here
till
this
morning
.
For
of
Beren
and
Luthien	B-PER
was
born
Dior	B-PER
Thingol	I-PER
s
heir
;
and
of
him
Elwing	B-PER
the
White
whom
Earendil	B-PER
wedded
,
he
that
sailed
his
ship
out
of
the
mists
of
the
world
into
the
seas
of
heaven
with
the
Silmaril
upon
his
brow
.
He
began
to
take
an
interest
in
the
Shire	B-LOC
before
Mordor	B-LOC
did
.
I
want
to
see
the
wild
country
again
before
I
die
,
and
the
Mountains
;
but
he
is
still
in
love
with
the
Shire	B-LOC
,
with
woods
and
fields
and
little
rivers
.
The
forest
began
to
draw
nearer
.
Of
Numenor	B-LOC
he
spoke
,
its
glory
and
its
fall
,
and
the
return
of
the
Kings
of
Men
to
Middle	B-LOC
earth	I-LOC
out
of
the
deeps
of
the
Sea
,
borne
upon
the
wings
of
storm
.
There
they
stood
,
stooping
in
a
circle
round
the
little
dancing
and
blowing
flames
.
Maybe
there
is
some
that
want
to
know
what
has
become
of
the
gold
and
jewels
that
he
buried
in
the
hill
of
Hobbiton	B-LOC
,
as
I
hear
?
’
Frodo	B-PER
said
nothing
:
the
shrewd
guesses
of
the
farmer
were
rather
disconcerting
.
And
he
took
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
under
the
sunlit
sky
,
and
he
cared
not
that
they
stood
high
upon
the
walls
in
the
sight
of
many
.
Sounds
too
easy
at
any
rate
in
the
telling
.
But
the
Ring
was
lost
.
Right
across
the
floor
,
close
to
the
feet
of
two
huge
pillars
a
great
fissure
had
opened
.
Very
lucky
you
came
this
way
.
It
is
time
to
get
up
.
And
I
don
t
remember
any
moon
,
either
new
or
old
,
in
Caras	B-LOC
Galadhon	I-LOC
:
only
stars
by
night
and
sun
by
day
.
A
star
came
out
above
the
trees
in
the
darkening
East
before
them
.
No
one
had
a
more
attentive
audience
than
old
Flam	B-PER
Gamgee	I-PER
,
commonly
known
as
the
Gaffer	B-PER
.
They
have
been
summoned
,
said
Elladan	B-PER
.
He
is
here
no
longer
,
and
we
must
now
look
after
ourselves
and
make
our
own
way
to
Rivendell	B-LOC
,
as
best
we
can
.
Loose
us
!
Loose
us
!
he
said
.
It
is
my
burden
,
and
no
one
else
can
bear
it
.
It
was
also
clear
that
Tom	B-PER
had
dealings
with
the
Elves
,
and
it
seemed
that
in
some
fashion
,
news
had
reached
him
from
Gildor	B-LOC
concerning
the
flight
of
Frodo	B-PER
.
There
are
loose
slabs
that
may
tilt
up
and
throw
you
down
into
a
pit
,
if
you
don
t
take
care
.
Come
!
said
Aragorn	B-PER
.
In
the
days
of
fair
weather
we
led
Gollum	B-PER
through
the
woods
;
and
there
was
a
high
tree
standing
alone
far
from
the
others
which
he
liked
to
climb
.
Not
yet
.
They
are
all
roused
now
,
and
their
mind
is
all
on
one
thing
:
breaking
Isengard	B-LOC
.
The
mountains
were
veiled
in
deepening
dusk
,
and
the
wind
was
cold
.
Silly
old
fool
.
If
you
would
understand
them
better
,
then
I
bid
you
come
with
me
,
said
Aragorn	B-PER
;
for
that
way
I
now
shall
take
.
We
will
go
together
.
Aragorn	B-PER
halted
and
examined
the
tracks
closely
.
Men
now
hurried
out
to
them
from
the
City
;
and
soon
they
all
passed
from
sight
under
the
outer
walls
,
and
he
knew
that
they
were
entering
the
Gate
.
The
sickle
Moon
was
gleaming
dimly
among
the
leaves
.
But
now
suddenly
his
errand
returned
to
his
memory
,
and
he
ran
forward
.
Not
without
Mr.
Frodo	B-PER
.
Then
let
us
start
as
soon
as
it
is
light
tomorrow
,
if
we
can
,
said
Boromir	B-PER
.
And
the
air
is
wholesome
there
because
of
the
outlets
through
fissures
in
the
rock
far
above
.
Did
you
see
them
again
,
Mr.
Frodo	B-PER
?
asked
Sam
,
as
they
sat
,
stiff
and
chilled
,
munching
wafers
of
_lembas_
,
in
the
cold
grey
of
early
morning
.
I
have
done
my
best
.
And
if
you
make
so
much
noise
,
you
ll
wake
the
Chief
s
Big
Man
.
What
s
made
you
change
your
mind
about
climbing
?
I
haven
t
changed
my
mind
.
He
fell
and
came
heavily
on
his
hands
,
which
sank
deep
into
sticky
ooze
,
so
that
his
face
was
brought
close
to
the
surface
of
the
dark
mere
.
The
other
three
went
on
.
Upon
the
battlement
nothing
could
be
seen
.
There
are
the
emblems
of
Durin	B-PER
!
cried
Gimli	B-PER
.
The
moon
as
it
rose
seemed
to
hang
for
a
moment
above
his
head
and
glistened
in
his
white
hair
as
the
wind
stirred
it
.
But
we
have
suffered
much
loss
in
our
battles
with
Saruman	B-PER
the
traitor
,
and
we
must
still
think
of
our
frontier
to
the
north
and
east
,
as
his
own
tidings
make
clear
.
’
Where
did
you
learn
such
tales
,
if
all
the
land
is
empty
and
forgetful
?
’
asked
Peregrin	B-PER
.
They
were
steering
,
as
well
as
they
could
guess
,
for
the
gate
like
opening
at
the
far
northward
end
of
the
long
valley
which
they
had
seen
in
the
morning
.
Day
is
drawing
to
an
end
,
yet
Gandalf	B-PER
says
you
must
go
ere
nightfall
,
and
the
Lord
of
the
Mark
is
eager
for
his
own
house
.
I
hope
so
,
said
Strider	B-PER
.
You
told
us
that
you
had
once
passed
through
the
Mines
.
I
must
be
trotting
.
Some
thing
scared
Mr.
Frodo	B-PER
badly
.
With
his
last
failing
senses
Frodo	B-PER
heard
cries
,
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
saw
,
beyond
the
Riders
that
hesitated
on
the
shore
,
a
shining
figure
of
white
light
;
and
behind
it
ran
small
shadowy
forms
waving
flames
,
that
flared
red
in
the
grey
mist
that
was
falling
over
the
world
.
Here
s
the
Gate
,
and
it
looks
to
me
as
if
that
s
about
as
far
as
we
are
ever
going
to
get
.
Gandalf	B-PER
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
span
,
leaning
on
the
staff
in
his
left
hand
,
but
in
his
other
hand
Glamdring
gleamed
,
cold
and
white
.
Maybe
you
re
right
,
said
Frodo	B-PER
,
avoiding
the
farmer
s
eye
and
staring
at
the
fire
.
Yes
,
the
Ring
,
said
Merry	B-PER
.
Bless
you
,
Gimli	B-PER
,
son
of
Gloin	B-PER
!
Maybe
you
will
see
us
both
together
one
day
and
judge
between
us
!
But
the
hobbits
!
Legolas	B-PER
broke
in
.
They
halted
suddenly
on
the
edge
,
and
peered
through
the
tree
trunks
,
holding
their
breath
.
Well
,
that
was
years
ago
.
All
that
is
said
among
us
is
that
far
away
,
over
many
hills
and
rivers
,
live
the
halfling
folk
that
dwell
in
holes
in
sand
dunes
.
They
had
not
seen
the
Lord
and
Lady
again
,
and
they
had
little
speech
with
the
Elven
folk
;
for
few
of
these
knew
or
would
use
the
Westron
tongue
.
Had
you
this
thing
in
keeping
?
It
is
hidden
,
you
say
;
but
is
not
that
because
you
choose
to
hide
it
?
No
,
not
because
I
choose
,
answered
Frodo	B-PER
.
They
were
taken
by
surprise
.
A
golden
afternoon
of
late
sunshine
lay
warm
and
drowsy
upon
the
hidden
land
between
.
From
Lamedon	B-LOC
,
a
few
grim
hillmen
without
a
captain
.
All
know
in
Gondor	B-LOC
that
he
went
first
to
Minas	B-LOC
Anor	I-LOC
and
dwelt
a
while
with
his
nephew
Meneldil	B-PER
,
instructing
him
,
before
he
committed
to
him
the
rule
of
the
South	B-LOC
Kingdom	I-LOC
.
A
good
day
for
strolling
on
their
way
along
the
groves
and
glades
of
Ithilien	B-LOC
;
but
though
Orcs
may
shun
the
sunlight
.
Pippin	B-PER
sat
miserably
by
the
door
in
the
pitch
dark
;
but
he
kept
on
turning
round
,
fearing
that
some
unknown
thing
would
crawl
up
out
of
the
well
.
There
were
piles
of
refuse
everywhere
.
Ho
la
!
You
up
there
,
you
dunghill
rat
!
Stop
your
squeaking
,
or
I
ll
come
and
deal
with
you
.
Twitching
aside
his
grey
cloak
,
Pippin	B-PER
drew
forth
his
small
sword
and
laid
it
at
Denethor	B-PER
s
feet
.
As
they
went
forward
the
hills
about
them
steadily
rose
.
Then
,
Eowyn	B-PER
of
Rohan	B-LOC
,
I
say
to
you
that
you
are
beautiful
.
An
eastward
bend
led
them
hard
by
the
sward
of
Mirrormere	B-LOC
,
and
there
not
far
from
the
roadside
stood
a
single
column
broken
at
the
top
.
We
must
be
off
,
he
said
.
See
,
my
precious
:
if
we
has
it
,
then
we
can
escape
,
even
from
Him
,
eh
?
Perhaps
we
grows
very
strong
,
stronger
than
Wraiths
.
It
was
moving
fast
then
,
muttered
Aragorn	B-PER
,
and
not
with
the
wind
.
If
you
mean
the
old
bogey
stories
Fatty	B-PER
s
nurses
used
to
tell
him
,
about
goblins
and
wolves
and
things
of
that
sort
,
I
should
say
no
.
And
I
will
begin
that
tale
,
though
others
shall
end
it
.
Yet
that
would
have
to
be
done
that
very
night
,
before
they
all
went
to
bed
.
You
cannot
cross
the
rivers
again
,
and
behind
you
there
are
now
secret
sentinels
that
you
cannot
pass
.
There
you
are
,
Frodo	B-PER
!
said
Merry	B-PER
.
Yet
in
the
wizard
s
face
he
saw
at
first
only
lines
of
care
and
sorrow
;
though
as
he
looked
more
intently
he
perceived
that
under
all
there
was
a
great
joy
:
a
fountain
of
mirth
enough
to
set
a
kingdom
laughing
,
were
it
to
gush
forth
.
Yet
not
no
hope
.
I
can
t
stay
here
,
he
said
wildly
.
Never
did
I
make
a
greater
mistake
!
However
,
I
wrote
a
message
to
Frodo	B-PER
,
and
trusted
to
my
friend
the
innkeeper
to
send
it
to
him
.
At
the
same
moment
they
became
aware
that
the
hedges
on
both
sides
,
just
above
their
heads
,
were
all
lined
with
hobbits
.
Many
of
his
own
favourite
things
or
Bilbo	B-PER
s
things
(
they
reminded
him
sharply
of
him
in
their
new
selling
)
were
arranged
as
nearly
as
possible
as
they
had
been
at
Bag	B-LOC
End	I-LOC
.
It
cannot
be
doubted
that
we
witness
the
meeting
of
dear
friends
,
said
Theoden	B-PER
.
Ai
oi
!
he
shouted
.
Nob	B-PER
trotted
off
with
a
grin
and
a
wink
.
He
was
altogether
wretched
.
Suddenly
Faramir	B-PER
stirred
,
and
he
opened
his
eyes
,
and
he
looked
on
Aragorn	B-PER
who
bent
over
him
;
and
a
light
of
knowledge
and
love
was
kindled
in
his
eyes
,
and
he
spoke
softly
.
Gandalf	B-PER
snuffed
the
air
and
looked
back
.
And
seen
closer
in
the
light
of
two
candles
that
he
lit
and
carried
before
them
the
landlord
s
face
looked
rather
wrinkled
and
careworn
.
It
began
last
night
at
sunset
.
And
we
ll
save
the
Precious
,
as
we
promised
.
’
He
wished
them
good
night
,
and
they
said
no
more
;
but
Frodo	B-PER
could
see
in
the
lantern
light
that
the
man
was
still
eyeing
them
curiously
.
This
is
Sting
,
’
he
said
,
and
thrust
it
with
little
effort
deep
into
a
wooden
beam
.
The
landlord
introduced
the
newcomers
to
the
Bree	B-LOC
folk
,
so
quickly
that
,
though
they
caught
many
names
,
they
were
seldom
sure
who
the
names
belonged
to
.
Hey
!
Come
derry
dol
!
Hop
along
,
my
hearties
!
Hobbits
!
Ponies
all
!
We
are
fond
of
parties
.
We
ve
got
to
make
a
dash
for
it
!
All
right
,
Sam	B-PER
,
said
Frodo	B-PER
.
But
it
would
be
politer
in
any
case
for
the
challenger
to
say
who
he
is
.
Into
what
deadly
perils
he
had
gone
alone
I
dared
not
guess
.
Then
we
formed
our
conspiracy
;
and
as
we
were
serious
,
too
,
and
meant
business
,
we
have
not
been
too
scrupulous
.
For
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
set
out
only
just
in
time
,
if
indeed
you
are
in
time
.
Therefore
I
went
first
to
meet
him
and
hear
his
tale
.
What
does
he
want
for
it
?
Bill	B-PER
Ferny	I-PER
s
price
was
twelve
silver
pennies
;
and
that
was
indeed
at
least
three
times
the
pony
s
value
in
those
pans
.
Or
is
it
one
of
your
imitations
?
It
does
not
sound
altogether
encouraging
.
It
was
green
and
stagnant
,
thrust
out
like
a
slimy
arm
towards
the
enclos
ing
hills
.
Legolas	B-PER
and
I
wish
for
a
closer
view
.
Strider	B-PER
had
drawn
the
curtains
and
pushed
back
the
shutters
with
a
clang
.
Pale
waters
lapped
about
its
feet
.
Ride
on
!
Ride
on
!
cried
Glorfindel	B-PER
,
and
then
loud
and
clear
he
called
to
the
horse
in
the
elf
tongue
:
_noro
lim
,
noro
lim
,
Asfaloth
!
_
At
once
the
white
horse
sprang
away
and
sped
like
the
wind
along
the
last
lap
of
the
Road
.
Well
,
I
see
you
have
ideas
of
your
own
,
’
he
said
.
And
I
have
spent
most
of
the
years
since
then
in
finding
out
the
truth
of
it
.
And
we
d
better
be
a
bit
more
watchful
ourselves
,
or
we
ll
feel
some
nasty
fingers
round
our
necks
one
of
these
nights
,
if
we
ever
wake
up
to
feel
anything
.
O
nice
hobbits
!
Smeagol	B-PER
brings
them
up
secret
ways
that
nobody
else
could
find
.
And
are
not
the
bridges
of
Osgiliath	B-LOC
broken
down
and
all
the
landings
held
now
by
the
Enemy
?
On
which
side
will
you
journey
?
The
way
to
Minas	B-LOC
Tirith	I-LOC
lies
upon
this
side
,
upon
the
west
;
but
the
straight
road
of
the
Quest
lies
east
of
the
River
,
upon
the
darker
shore
.
You
can
t
be
thinking
of
doing
that
.
Frodo	B-PER
wandered
round
the
familiar
rooms
,
and
saw
the
light
of
the
sunset
fade
on
the
walls
,
and
shadows
creep
out
of
the
corners
.
But
Shelob	B-PER
was
not
as
dragons
are
,
no
softer
spot
had
she
save
only
her
eyes
.
Tell
me
of
these
havens
as
we
walk
.
But
it
was
an
old
tradition
that
away
over
there
stood
the
Grey	B-LOC
Havens	I-LOC
,
from
which
at
times
elven
ships
set
sail
,
never
to
return
.
Were
the
breath
of
the
West
Wind
to
take
a
body
visible
,
even
so
would
it
appear
,
said
Eomer	B-PER
,
as
the
great
horse
ran
up
,
until
he
stood
before
the
wizard
.
Still
there
s
seldom
less
than
a
score
round
the
Boss
,
as
they
names
him
.
Here
under
the
shadow
of
the
hills
there
had
been
some
rain
.
I
wish
to
help
you
.
Come
!
Do
as
you
promised
:
give
it
up
!
Well
,
if
you
want
my
ring
yourself
,
say
so
!
cried
Bilbo	B-PER
.
Well
,
have
a
care
!
said
Boromir	B-PER
.
These
things
the
Elves
of
Middle	B-LOC
earth	I-LOC
have
in
some
measure
gained
,
though
with
sorrow
.
True
words
doubtless
;
yet
all
such
comfort
is
cold
.
There
was
a
ring
and
clatter
as
the
Company	B-ORG
drew
their
swords
.
It
is
dry
at
least
,
and
there
is
food
,
though
no
fire
.
The
morning
was
now
far
advanced
.
He
tarried
there
from
errantry
,
and
melodies
they
taught
to
him
,
and
sages
old
him
marvels
told
,
and
harps
of
gold
they
brought
to
him
.
Who
are
you
,
and
what
do
you
want
?
I
am
called
Strider	B-PER
,
he
answered
:
and
though
he
may
have
forgotten
it
,
your
friend
promised
to
have
a
quiet
talk
with
me
.
They
had
a
struggle
to
get
out
of
the
thicket
.
He
looked
at
them
with
half
closed
eyes
.
We
have
two
more
ropes
.
We
were
just
wondering
where
it
would
be
safe
to
lie
and
get
some
sleep
,
when
the
most
amazing
thing
of
all
happened
.
’
But
in
that
time
also
he
made
this
scroll
,
’
said
Gandalf	B-PER
;
and
that
is
not
remembered
in
Gondor	B-LOC
,
it
would
seem
.
Why
had
his
master
let
him
sleep
on
out
of
turn
,
right
on
till
evening
?
Haven
t
you
had
no
sleep
,
Mr.
Frodo	B-PER
?
he
said
.
He
needs
rest
.
All
along
it
for
many
leagues
east
of
the
Bridge
there
are
trees
growing
.
We
will
sit
on
the
edge
of
ruin
and
talk
,
as
Gandalf	B-PER
says
,
while
he
is
busy
elsewhere
.
A
fierce
eager
will
was
there
.
The
enemy
before
them
seemed
to
have
grown
rather
than
diminished
,
still
more
were
pressing
up
from
the
valley
through
the
breach
.
’
Too
warm
,
I
shouldn’t
wonder
,
’
muttered
Sam	B-PER
to
Frodo	B-PER
.
It
s
heavy
on
me
,
Sam
lad
,
very
heavy
.
Gilgalad	B-LOC
is
_Starlight_
in
their
tongue
.
The
path
went
on
again
from
the
door
,
and
turning
to
the
right
again
across
the
level
space
plunged
down
a
thick
wooded
slope
.
The
Orcs
whom
we
pursued
took
captive
two
of
my
friends
.
In
the
afternoon
Ugluk	B-PER
s
troop
overtook
the
Northerners
.
My
Precious
!
O
my
Precious
!
And
with
that
,
even
as
his
eyes
were
lifted
up
to
gloat
on
his
prize
,
he
stepped
too
far
,
toppled
,
wavered
for
a
moment
on
the
brink
,
and
then
with
a
shriek
he
fell
.
That
cheered
them
greatly
;
for
it
was
good
to
see
a
sight
of
anything
beyond
the
wood’s
borders
,
though
they
did
not
mean
to
go
that
way
,
if
they
could
help
it
:
the
Barrow	B-LOC
downs	I-LOC
had
as
sinister
a
reputation
in
hobbit
legend
as
the
Forest
itself
.
They
had
done
nearly
fourteen
miles
with
only
one
rest
at
noon
.
More
difficult
,
not
so
quick
;
but
better
,
if
we
don
t
want
Him
to
see
.
Do
not
let
him
run
away
!
said
Boromir	B-PER
.
Beside
Glorfindel	B-PER
there
were
several
other
counsellors
of
Elrond’s	B-PER
household
,
of
whom
Erestor	B-PER
was
the
chief
;
and
with
him
was
Galdor	B-PER
,
an
Elf
from
the
Grey	B-LOC
Havens	I-LOC
who
had
come
on
an
errand
from
Cirdan	B-PER
the
Shipwright
.
The
travellers
now
rode
with
more
speed
,
and
they
made
their
way
towards
the
Gap	B-LOC
of	I-LOC
Rohan	I-LOC
;
and
Aragorn	B-PER
took
leave
of
them
at
last
close
to
that
very
place
where
Pippin	B-PER
had
looked
into
the
Stone
of
Orthanc	B-LOC
.
And
thereupon
the
middle
door
of
the
Black	B-LOC
Gate	I-LOC
was
thrown
open
with
a
great
clang
,
and
out
of
it
there
came
an
embassy
from
the
Dark	B-LOC
Tower	I-LOC
.
Leastways
old
Bilbo	B-PER
was
cracked
,
and
Frodo’s	B-PER
cracking
.
I
saw
a
dark
sky
,
and
tall
battlements
,
he
said
.
Go
on
!
’
said
Frodo	B-PER
.
Is
it
not
a
law
in
the
City
that
those
who
wear
the
black
and
silver
must
stay
in
the
Citadel
,
unless
their
lord
gives
them
leave
?
He
has
,
said
Pippin	B-PER
.
And
I
don
t
wish
to
enter
it
even
once
,
said
Pippin	B-PER
.
It
depends
on
many
chances
.
Gloom
settled
still
more
heavily
on
Pippin	B-PER
.
He
felt
that
he
was
lying
in
a
soft
slimy
bog
,
and
springing
up
he
set
his
fool
on
the
corner
of
a
cold
hard
flagstone
.
It
is
no
good
saying
any
more
.
All
they
could
do
was
to
follow
the
fold
downwards
.
Why
that
way
,
I
wonder
?
He
turned
.
But
if
you
ll
pardon
my
speaking
out
,
I
think
my
master
was
right
.
Ever
the
horn
blasts
wound
on
among
the
hills
;
nearer
now
and
louder
they
answered
one
to
another
,
blowing
fierce
and
free
.
Well
,
’
the
farmer
continued
,
approaching
his
point
with
slow
relish
,
he
came
riding
on
a
big
black
horse
in
at
the
gate
,
which
happened
to
be
open
,
and
right
up
to
my
door
.
All
that
he
could
remember
about
Rohan	B-LOC
was
that
Gandalf	B-PER
s
horse
,
Shadowfax	B-PER
,
had
come
from
that
land
.
Smeagol	B-PER
helps
again
.
We
cannot
go
further
tonight
,
’
said
Boromir	B-PER
.
I
think
,
nonetheless
,
that
we
no
longer
need
any
trail
to
tell
us
which
way
to
go
,
said
Gimli	B-PER
.
Do
Elves
live
in
those
woods
?
he
asked
.
Stone
rings
grinned
out
of
the
ground
like
broken
teeth
in
the
moonlight
.
Indeed
the
hobbits
felt
that
the
hair
on
their
heads
was
actually
standing
up
,
waving
and
curling
and
growing
.
Must
get
up
,
yes
they
must
!
he
said
.
In
pairs
they
galloped
by
,
and
though
every
now
and
then
one
rose
in
his
stirrups
and
gazed
ahead
and
to
either
side
,
they
appeared
not
to
perceive
the
three
strangers
sitting
silently
and
watching
them
.
But
he
came
too
late
,
for
once
,
and
the
battle
was
over
and
beyond
his
help
before
he
reached
these
parts
.
If
there
are
hobbit
folk
in
these
pans
,
why
don
t
we
look
for
some
that
would
be
willing
to
take
us
in
?
It
would
be
more
homelike
.
We
feared
that
Saruman	B-PER
was
brewing
some
new
devilry
for
us
.
I
wonder
,
said
Strider	B-PER
,
looking
round
thoughtfully
.
Still
,
he
said
,
standing
suddenly
up
and
sticking
out
his
chin
.
All
that
day
the
Company	B-ORG
marched
on
,
until
they
felt
the
cool
evening
come
and
heard
the
early
night
wind
whispering
among
many
leaves
.
’
Legolas	B-PER
stirred
in
his
boat
.
Where
d
you
think
you
re
going
?
said
one
,
the
largest
and
most
evil
looking
of
the
crew
.
I
should
like
a
bit
of
information
as
well
as
danger
.
Some
I
cannot
trust
,
and
those
I
can
trust
are
too
dear
to
me
:
poor
old
Sam	B-PER
,
and
Merry	B-PER
and
Pippin	B-PER
.
He
sighed
.
As
Frodo	B-PER
prepared
to
follow
him
,
he
laid
his
hand
upon
the
tree
beside
the
ladder
:
never
before
had
he
been
so
suddenly
and
so
keenly
aware
of
the
feel
and
texture
of
a
tree
s
skin
and
of
the
life
within
it
.
He
has
led
us
in
here
against
our
fears
,
but
he
will
lead
us
out
again
,
at
whatever
cost
to
himself
.
But
now
Frodo	B-PER
often
met
strange
dwarves
of
far
countries
,
seeking
refuge
in
the
West
.
There
s
more
stored
in
your
head
than
you
let
on
about
.
’
Yes
,
it
all
comes
back
to
me
now
,
’
said
Frodo	B-PER
:
the
tremen
dous
roaring
.
I
will
not
do
this
deed
.
There
was
nothing
to
be
seen
.
He
knows
it
.
Think
of
the
riddles
they
both
knew
,
for
one
thing
.
Not
far
beyond
them
the
stream
becomes
clear
and
smooth
again
,
though
it
runs
swiftly
.
And
then
they
lost
no
more
time
.
A
strong
wind
from
the
West
was
now
driving
the
fumes
of
Mordor	B-LOC
from
the
upper
airs
.
I
should
know
,
for
I
had
one
to
tend
in
the
Houses
.
And
nothing
will
ever
be
all
right
where
that
piece
of
misery
is
.
’
Dangerous
or
not
,
a
real
sunrise
is
mighty
welcome
,
’
said
Frodo	B-PER
,
throwing
back
his
hood
and
letting
the
morning
light
fall
on
his
face
.
It
seemed
different
so
far
away
,
in
the
Shire	B-LOC
or
in
Rivendell	B-LOC
.
He
gazed
back
along
the
way
that
they
had
come
towards
the
night
gathering
in
the
East
.
Black
Riders
would
have
to
ride
over
him
to
get
near
the
waggon
.
At
last
lulled
by
the
wind
in
the
boughs
above
,
and
the
sweet
murmur
of
the
falls	B-LOC
of	I-LOC
Nimrodel	I-LOC
below
,
Frodo	B-PER
fell
asleep
with
the
song
of
Legolas	B-PER
running
in
his
mind
.
Yes
,
to
Mordor	B-LOC
,
’
said
Gandalf	B-PER
.
Beside
him
Merry	B-PER
lay
,
white
faced
,
with
a
dirty
rag
bound
across
his
brows
.
But
Aragorn	B-PER
dismounted
,
and
standing
by
the
Stone
he
cried
in
a
great
voice
:
Oathbreakers
,
why
have
ye
come
?
And
a
voice
was
heard
out
of
the
night
that
answered
him
,
as
if
from
far
away
:
To
fulfil
our
oath
and
have
peace
.
Before
long
they
had
all
passed
and
vanished
.
Soon
the
white
form
of
the
Lady
was
small
and
distant
.
Do
you
advise
me
to
look
?
asked
Frodo	B-PER
.
Ah
!
said
Aragorn	B-PER
.
And
then
there
are
some
trees
in
the
valleys
under
the
mountains
,
sound
as
a
bell
,
and
bad
right
through
.
The
rivers
long
defended
us
,
but
they
are
a
sure
guard
no
more
;
for
the
Shadow
has
crept
northward
all
about
us
.
There
are
none
.
In
their
dark
cloaks
they
were
as
invisible
as
if
they
all
had
magic
rings
.
Aragorn	B-PER
strode
on
through
the
inner
court
,
and
mounted
to
a
high
chamber
in
the
tower
.
Only
a
remnant
of
our
eastern
force
came
back
,
destroying
the
last
bridge
that
still
stood
amid
the
ruins	B-LOC
of	I-LOC
Osgiliath	I-LOC
.
Speak
no
more
of
it
!
But
so
it
is
,
Sam	B-PER
:
in
that
land
you
lost
your
count
.
It
is
cold
in
the
tree
tops
in
winter
,
though
the
wind
tonight
is
in
the
South
;
but
we
have
food
and
drink
to
give
you
that
will
drive
away
the
night
chill
,
and
we
have
skins
and
cloaks
to
spare
.
That’s
good
for
a
beginning
.
He
looked
on
the
bright
point
of
the
sword
.
They
roared
and
boomed
and
trumpeted
,
until
stones
began
to
crack
and
fall
at
the
mere
noise
of
them
.
’
The
night
wind
blew
chill
up
the
valley
to
meet
them
.
But
never
mind
.
The
three
hobbits
came
on
,
and
then
the
ruffians
turned
and
fled
running
away
up
the
Hobbiton	B-LOC
Road	I-LOC
;
but
they
blew
their
horns
as
they
ran
.
You
will
learn
that
your
trouble
is
but
part
of
the
trouble
of
all
the
western
world
.
I
reckon
it
isn
t
safe
for
us
both
to
sleep
together
,
and
begging
your
pardon
,
but
I
can
t
hold
up
my
lids
much
longer
.
So
I
stayed
there
that
night
,
wondering
much
what
had
become
of
the
Riders
;
for
only
of
two
had
there
yet
been
any
news
in
Bree	B-LOC
,
it
seemed
.
Give
me
your
bow
.
Great
trees
passed
by
like
ghosts
,
thrusting
their
twisted
thirsty
roots
through
the
mist
down
into
the
water
.
But
now
the
world
is
changing
once
again
.
The
dining
room
was
bare
except
for
a
table
and
chairs
,
but
the
food
was
good
,
and
there
was
good
wine
:
Frodo’s	B-PER
wine
had
not
been
included
in
the
sale
to
the
Sackville	B-PER
Bagginses	I-PER
.
The
world
was
darkling
.
The
others
slunk
away
.
I
have
returned
from
the
Northern	B-LOC
Fences	I-LOC
,
said
the
Elf
,
and
I
am
sent
now
to
be
your
guide
again
.
Swans
!
said
Sam	B-PER
.
Why
!
You
can
t
see
to
the
bottom
in
this
light
.
It
will
not
be
any
comfort
to
us
,
if
these
riders
discover
that
we
are
not
Orcs
after
we
are
dead
.
Sam	B-PER
looked
at
Frodo	B-PER
.
Do
as
you
please
in
your
madness
,
but
let
me
first
get
down
from
this
horse
!
I
wish
to
see
no
eyes
!
Stay
,
Legolas	B-PER
Greenleaf	I-PER
!
said
Gandalf	B-PER
.
But
I
can
t
keep
awake
any
longer
.
The
swords
flashed
from
the
sheath
as
one
.
They
just
want
a
match
,
though
,
and
they
ll
go
up
in
fire
.
I
need
a
change
,
or
something
.
The
cut
is
not
poisoned
,
as
the
wounds
of
orc
blades
too
often
are
.
My
heart
tells
me
that
Sauron	B-PER
will
expect
us
to
take
the
western
way
,
when
he
learns
what
has
befallen
.
The
day
waned
,
and
dusk
was
twined
about
the
boles
of
the
trees
.
Why
,
cousin
,
one
of
them
went
with
only
his
esquire
into
the
Black	B-LOC
Country	I-LOC
and
fought
with
the
Dark	B-PER
Lord	I-LORD
all
by
himself
,
and
set
fire
to
his
Tower
,
if
you
can
believe
it
.
Those
who
no
longer
wish
to
go
forward
may
remain
here
,
for
a
while
.
I’ll
say
you’re
dead
,
or
have
left
the
Shire	B-LOC
,
or
anything
you
like
.
