He
felt
the
cool
mud
about
his
toes
as
he
paddled
in
the
Pool
at
Bywater
with
Jolly
Cotton
and
Tom
and
Nibs
,
and
their
sister
Rosie
.
In
the
upper
rooms
were
little
rows
of
hard
beds
,
and
on
every
wall
there
was
a
notice
and
a
list
of
Rules
.
It
was
dark
,
and
white
stars
were
shining
,
when
Frodo
and
his
companions
came
at
last
to
the
Greenway
crossing
and
drew
near
the
village
.
While
Gollum
was
away
Sam
took
another
look
at
Frodo
.
’
Boromir
looked
in
surprise
at
Bilbo
,
but
the
laughter
died
on
his
lips
when
he
saw
that
all
the
others
regarded
the
old
hobbit
with
grave
respect
.
Sleep
,
if
you
can
!
To
the
Havens
,
Sam
,
said
Frodo
.
’
Let
us
see
what
Sting
may
show
,
’
answered
Aragorn
.
War
was
kindled
.
The
Sun
sinks
early
.
We
are
tree
herds
,
we
old
Ents
.
For
it
led
up
on
to
the
mountain
to
a
high
hallow
where
only
the
kings
had
been
wont
to
go
.
He
stepped
down
from
the
rock
,
and
picking
up
his
grey
cloak
wrapped
it
about
him
:
it
seemed
as
if
the
sun
had
been
shining
,
but
now
was
hid
in
cloud
again
.
Their
eyes
fell
on
him
and
pierced
him
,
as
they
rushed
towards
him
.
There
was
hot
soup
,
cold
meats
,
a
blackberry
tart
,
new
loaves
,
slabs
of
butter
,
and
half
a
ripe
cheese
:
good
plain
food
,
as
good
as
the
Shire
could
show
,
and
homelike
enough
to
dispel
the
last
of
Sam
s
misgivings
(
already
much
relieved
by
the
excellence
of
the
beer
)
.
Can
you
swear
that
none
escaped
your
net
in
such
a
way
?
And
it
would
seem
like
wisdom
but
for
the
warning
of
my
heart
.
We
have
passed
no
place
on
the
way
up
that
offered
more
shelter
than
this
cliff
wall
we
are
under
now
.
said
Aragorn
.
Frodo
and
Sam
stood
as
if
enchanted
.
The
sun
had
set
,
already
it
had
sunk
behind
the
rim
of
the
world
;
but
as
they
rode
out
from
the
shadow
of
the
hills
and
looked
west
to
the
Gap
of
Rohan
the
sky
was
still
red
,
and
a
burning
light
was
under
the
floating
clouds
.
Well
,
here
we
are
!
The
night
passed
silently
.
Sam
crouched
down
listening
.
There
is
a
road
out
of
this
valley
,
and
that
road
I
shall
take
.
Suddenly
Aragorn
leapt
to
his
feet
.
There
was
some
scattered
clapping
,
but
most
of
them
were
trying
to
work
it
out
and
see
if
it
came
to
a
compliment
.
A
large
knob
knuckled
hand
was
laid
on
each
of
their
shoulders
,
and
they
were
twisted
round
,
gently
but
irresistibly
;
then
two
great
arms
lifted
them
up
.
he
laughed
,
flicking
at
their
legs
.
The
years
had
gnawed
it
,
and
violent
hands
had
maimed
it
.
The
Nine
are
abroad
again
.
There
was
a
quarrel
,
I
guess
:
it
is
no
uncommon
thing
with
these
foul
folk
.
You
are
old
enough
,
and
perhaps
wise
enough
.
Westward
,
to
his
right
,
it
turned
,
skirting
the
shoulders
of
the
mountains
,
and
went
off
southwards
into
the
deep
shadows
that
mantled
all
the
western
sides
of
Ephel
D
ath
;
beyond
his
sight
it
journeyed
on
into
the
narrow
land
between
the
mountains
and
the
Great
River
.
It
seems
that
we
shall
need
him
still
,
if
the
wolves
do
not
find
us
.
Henceforward
I
will
call
nothing
fair
,
unless
it
be
her
gift
.
There
was
no
echo
or
answer
though
the
wood
seemed
to
become
more
crowded
and
more
watchful
than
before
.
I
don
t
know
if
the
Road
has
ever
been
measured
in
miles
beyond
the
_Forsaken
Inn
,
_
a
day
s
journey
east
of
Bree
,
answered
Strider
.
But
where
have
you
been
to
sneaking
off
and
sneaking
back
,
you
old
villain
?
We
bring
little
provision
,
for
we
rode
forth
to
open
battle
,
not
to
a
siege
.
’
I
hope
so
,
’
said
Strider
.
he
said
,
coming
near
and
speaking
now
in
a
softer
voice
.
Whatever
it
was
,
its
fall
has
dismayed
our
enemies
.
It
is
news
to
me
,
yet
it
does
not
surprise
me
.
Still
,
I
don’t
suppose
I
have
the
strength
or
luck
left
to
deal
with
the
Ring
.
Frodo
gasped
.
The
ground
seemed
to
quiver
under
their
feet
.
The
Ents
are
safe
,
said
Pippin
.
Ride
to
good
fortune
,
and
ride
back
soon
to
our
welcome
!
Dark
have
been
my
dreams
of
late
,
he
said
,
but
I
feel
as
one
new
awakened
.
There
was
a
roar
and
a
crackle
,
and
the
tree
above
him
burst
into
a
leaf
and
bloom
of
blinding
flame
.
The
waggon
seemed
slower
than
a
snail
to
Frodo
.
He
came
to
a
path
,
the
dwindling
ruins
of
a
road
of
long
ago
.
Glorfindel
caught
Frodo
as
he
sank
to
the
ground
,
and
taking
him
gently
in
his
arms
he
looked
in
his
face
with
grave
anxiety
.
What
is
it
at
?
They
tramped
off
,
anxious
and
downhearted
,
under
the
eyes
of
the
crowd
.
he
said
.
At
any
moment
now
he
knew
that
the
end
would
come
:
his
master
would
faint
or
fall
,
and
all
would
be
discovered
,
and
their
bitter
efforts
be
in
vain
.
It
was
his
downfall
,
as
I
now
perceive
.
The
answer
to
your
first
question
,
Boromir
,
said
the
wizard
,
is
that
I
do
not
know
the
word
yet
.
That
was
the
way
of
it
,
I
fear
.
You
were
inattentive
.
It
was
overlaid
with
a
tracery
of
flowers
and
leaves
wrought
of
silver
and
gold
,
and
on
it
were
set
in
elven
runes
formed
of
many
gems
the
name
Anduril
and
the
lineage
of
the
sword
.
He
reappeared
,
hat
first
,
over
the
brow
of
the
hill
,
and
behind
him
came
in
an
obedient
line
six
ponies
:
their
own
five
and
one
more
.
The
creature
is
wretched
and
hungry
,
said
Frodo
,
and
unaware
of
his
danger
.
I
am
not
going
to
do
anything
.
We
ought
to
do
a
good
step
more
today
.
But
west
would
lead
them
only
into
more
labour
and
delay
,
back
towards
the
heart
of
the
hills
;
east
would
take
them
to
the
outer
precipice
.
Who
made
the
track
,
do
you
suppose
,
and
why
?
I
cannot
get
a
wink
,
so
I
may
as
well
do
the
watching
.
’
Gandalf
’s
eyes
flashed
and
his
brows
stuck
out
like
bristles
.
I
can’t
keep
it
dark
any
longer
.
he
thought
.
’
she
said
.
A
thin
black
smoke
trailed
out
.
Fire
and
lamp
,
and
meat
and
bread
,
And
then
to
bed
!
But
they
had
no
chance
to
fly
yet
.
The
hills
drew
nearer
.
He
sighed
and
bent
his
head
.
B
.
Your
information
was
correct
,
I
said
.
I
need
your
Ring
:
that
you
know
now
;
but
I
give
you
my
word
that
I
do
not
desire
to
keep
it
.
These
words
shall
go
with
the
gift
,
’
she
said
.
said
Butterbur
.
Only
what
Bilbo
told
me
.
In
all
the
long
wars
with
the
Dark
Tower
treason
has
ever
been
our
greatest
foe
.
Nonetheless
he
drew
near
,
and
saw
Aragorn
kneeling
,
while
Elladan
held
aloft
both
torches
.
Even
as
he
swooned
he
caught
,
as
through
a
swirling
mist
,
a
glimpse
of
Strider
leaping
out
of
the
darkness
with
a
flaming
brand
of
wood
in
either
hand
.
We
did
not
bring
them
to
rest
against
your
wall
,
Lord
of
the
Mark
.
That
is
the
doom
that
we
must
deem
.
Alas
!
I
come
from
yonder
,
he
said
,
slow
and
stiff
like
,
pointing
back
west
,
over
_my_
fields
,
if
you
please
.
At
ninety
he
was
much
the
same
as
at
fifty
.
’
said
Aragorn
.
I
had
to
come
with
you
.
But
when
they
had
drunk
she
commanded
them
to
sit
again
on
the
grass
,
and
chairs
were
set
for
her
and
for
Celeborn
.
But
Saruman
will
try
to
stop
you
.
Pippin
could
see
that
his
old
brow
was
wrinkled
and
knotted
.
And
when
they
had
reckoned
up
all
their
strength
and
taken
thought
for
the
journeys
they
should
make
and
the
roads
they
should
choose
,
Imrahil
suddenly
laughed
aloud
.
On
it
roughly
cut
and
now
much
weathered
could
still
be
seen
dwarf
runes
and
secret
marks
.
Gimli
rose
and
planted
his
feet
firmly
apart
:
his
hand
gripped
the
handle
of
his
axe
,
and
his
dark
eyes
flashed
.
I
am
just
going
to
saddle
the
ponies
,
and
fetch
the
one
that
is
to
be
the
baggage
carrier
.
But
we
will
put
it
to
the
test
one
day
.
So
they
talked
until
the
sun
reached
its
height
,
and
suddenly
the
noon
bells
were
rung
,
and
there
was
a
stir
in
the
citadel
;
for
all
save
the
watchmen
were
going
to
their
meal
.
Nothing
,
Sam
Gamgee
;
but
you
ve
got
to
keep
awake
all
the
same
.
he
said
.
More
than
ever
.
Yes
,
sir
,
I
am
afraid
so
,
sir
,
said
Butterbur
,
mistaking
me
.
Every
now
and
again
a
tiny
red
gleam
far
away
flickered
upwards
on
the
rim
of
earth
and
sky
.
That
he
will
never
do
now
.
She
snorted
,
and
showed
plainly
that
she
thought
the
Gamgees
capable
of
plundering
the
hole
during
the
night
.
But
come
on
now
,
lads
!
And
then
the
head
lay
quietly
back
again
in
rest
.
he
said
.
How
was
it
that
they
all
died
?
So
that’s
where
that
southerner
is
hiding
!
But
we
ride
on
horses
tall
and
swift
,
said
Th
oden
;
and
great
though
your
heart
be
,
you
cannot
ride
on
such
beasts
.
That
day
the
weather
changed
again
,
almost
as
if
it
was
at
the
command
of
some
power
that
had
no
longer
any
use
for
snow
,
since
they
had
retreated
from
the
pass
,
a
power
that
wished
now
to
have
a
clear
light
in
which
things
that
moved
in
the
wild
could
be
seen
from
far
away
.
’
Frodo
shuddered
,
remembering
the
cruel
knife
with
notched
blade
that
had
vanished
in
Strider’s
hands
.
Dead
silence
was
around
him
,
and
over
all
hung
a
clear
blue
sky
,
as
the
Sun
rode
up
from
the
East
.
If
we
make
no
answer
,
the
Enemy
may
move
Men
of
his
rule
to
assail
King
Brand
,
and
D
in
also
.
Just
in
time
he
threw
himself
down
in
a
patch
of
long
grass
behind
a
tree
that
overshadowed
the
road
.
said
Pippin
.
But
that
is
only
a
few
leaves
in
a
forest
.
But
even
as
they
were
hurrying
across
they
heard
far
away
two
cries
:
a
cold
voice
calling
and
a
cold
voice
answering
.
Well
,
be
off
with
you
!
Wake
up
Mr.
’
asked
Frodo
.
The
black
figures
passed
swiftly
in
.
I
see
Elf
lords
here
.
He
is
a
strong
king
,
and
his
realm
now
reaches
far
south
and
east
of
Esgaroth
.
Now
,
I
fear
,
we
must
say
farewell
to
Balin
son
of
Fundin
.
He
raised
his
eyes
with
difficulty
to
the
dark
slopes
of
Mount
Doom
towering
above
him
,
and
then
pitifully
he
began
to
crawl
forward
on
his
hands
.
All
the
lands
were
grey
and
still
;
and
ever
the
shadow
deepened
before
them
,
and
hope
waned
in
every
heart
.
And
I
do
not
sit
down
.
On
the
benches
were
various
folk
:
men
of
Bree
,
a
collection
of
local
hobbits
(
sitting
chattering
together
)
,
a
few
more
dwarves
,
and
other
vague
figures
difficult
to
make
out
away
in
the
shadows
and
comers
.
Frodo
.
All
ready
to
start
?
Frodo
did
not
even
hear
his
cries
.
Frodo
asked
,
when
he
got
a
chance
to
whisper
to
Mr.
You
re
right
,
master
,
he
said
,
and
I
beg
your
pardon
.
Gandalf
walked
in
front
as
before
.
cried
Pippin
.
Thus
shall
I
sleep
better
.
Haven
t
you
any
lock
ups
down
below
?
The
dragon
passed
like
an
express
train
,
turned
a
somersault
,
and
burst
over
Bywater
with
a
deafening
explosion
.
Frodo
halted
and
looked
out
over
the
River
,
far
below
him
,
to
Tol
Brandir
and
the
birds
wheeling
in
the
great
gulf
of
air
between
him
and
the
untrodden
isle
.
Escaped
?
Yet
I
could
wish
,
were
it
of
any
avail
,
that
the
One
Ring
had
never
been
wrought
,
or
had
remained
for
ever
lost
.
Tell
us
your
tale
.
grunted
the
one
.
But
harder
than
stone
is
the
flesh
and
bone
Of
a
troll
that
sits
in
the
hills
alone
.
_The_
Ent
,
I
am
,
you
might
say
,
in
your
manner
of
speaking
.
Helm
!
Indeed
I
have
heard
that
for
them
memory
is
more
like
to
the
waking
world
than
to
a
dream
.
Some
went
off
down
the
highway
to
the
Fords
,
and
some
turned
away
:
and
went
eastward
.
They
returned
now
to
the
ruins
of
the
gate
.
He
climbed
up
and
found
Legolas
beside
Aragorn
and
omer
.
Imagine
it
:
going
off
to
Mordor
alone
!
Looking
in
a
mirror
he
was
startled
to
see
a
much
thinner
reflection
of
himself
than
he
remembered
:
it
looked
remarkably
like
the
young
nephew
of
Bilbo
who
used
to
go
tramping
with
his
uncle
in
the
Shire
;
but
the
eyes
looked
out
at
him
thoughtfully
.
Nay
,
I
do
not
think
I
will
come
up
.
Tom
could
be
heard
about
the
house
,
clattering
in
the
kitchen
,
and
up
and
down
the
stairs
,
and
singing
here
and
there
outside
.
And
I
wanted
to
go
away
,
but
I
couldn
t
.
The
earth
groaned
and
quaked
.
I
guess
that
it
began
with
their
coming
to
Dimrill
Dale
nigh
on
thirty
years
ago
:
the
pages
seem
to
have
numbers
referring
to
the
years
after
their
arrival
.
But
I
warrant
you
haven
t
seen
them
doing
it
;
nor
any
one
else
in
the
Shire
.
Neither
have
we
done
harm
to
the
Elves
.
The
air
grew
hot
and
stifling
,
but
it
was
not
foul
,
and
at
times
they
felt
currents
of
cooler
air
upon
their
faces
,
issuing
from
half
guessed
openings
in
the
walls
.
Now
I
must
go
down
to
meet
those
who
come
.
He
tarried
there
from
errantry
,
and
melodies
they
taught
to
him
,
and
sages
old
him
marvels
told
,
and
harps
of
gold
they
brought
to
him
.
Yet
it
is
not
yours
to
give
me
,
even
if
you
would
;
and
only
through
darkness
shall
I
come
to
it
.
The
others
too
now
turned
their
eyes
eastward
.
Two
hundreds
,
what
are
they
?
he
cried
.
Suddenly
in
the
distance
the
S
.
Frodo
wondered
whether
he
was
ill
(
if
people
were
ever
ill
in
Rivendell
)
,
and
had
been
unable
to
come
to
the
feast
.
I
am
afraid
he
is
out
.
It
was
no
brigand
or
orc
chieftain
that
ordered
the
assault
upon
the
Lord
of
Mordor
s
greatest
foe
.
He
died
to
save
us
,
my
kinsman
Meriadoc
and
myself
,
waylaid
in
the
woods
by
the
soldiery
of
the
Dark
Lord
;
and
though
he
fell
and
failed
,
my
gratitude
is
none
the
less
.
Up
this
path
they
rode
.
Merry
was
looking
from
side
to
side
,
and
seemed
already
uncertain
which
way
to
go
.
So
bright
was
it
that
the
figure
of
the
Elven
lady
cast
a
dim
shadow
on
the
ground
.
The
plain
was
dark
with
their
marching
companies
,
and
as
far
as
eyes
could
strain
in
the
mirk
there
sprouted
,
like
a
foul
fungus
growth
,
all
about
the
beleaguered
city
great
camps
of
tents
,
black
or
sombre
red
.
Even
now
he
looked
at
the
stone
trolls
with
sus
picion
,
wondering
if
some
magic
might
not
suddenly
bring
them
to
life
again
.
Suddenly
they
came
out
of
the
trees
and
found
themselves
in
a
wide
circular
space
.
Still
I
for
one
am
glad
that
he
is
safely
kept
by
the
watchful
Elves
of
Mirkwood
.
But
Frodo
found
no
words
to
answer
.
Gandalf
it
was
that
last
spoke
to
Faramir
ere
he
rode
east
.
Gimli
the
dwarf
alone
wore
openly
a
short
shirt
of
steel
rings
,
for
dwarves
make
light
of
burdens
;
and
in
his
belt
was
a
broad
bladed
axe
.
Speak
!
he
said
in
a
low
voice
.
What
is
the
house
of
Eorl
but
a
thatched
barn
where
brigands
drink
in
the
reek
,
and
their
brats
roll
on
the
floor
among
their
dogs
?
The
ruins
of
what
seemed
a
very
war
tower
lay
upon
his
heaving
back
,
smashed
in
his
furious
passage
through
the
woods
;
and
high
upon
his
neck
still
desperately
clung
a
tiny
figure
the
body
of
a
mighty
warrior
,
a
giant
among
the
Swertings
.
At
last
Mr.
’
They
stumbled
wildly
up
the
great
stairs
beyond
the
door
,
Aragorn
leading
,
Boromir
at
the
rear
.
We
re
_hobbits_
.
Come
then
!
It
was
not
a
Balrog
,
said
Frodo
,
still
shivering
with
the
chill
that
had
come
upon
him
.
Say
to
your
brother
:
beyond
the
shadows
we
may
meet
again
!
At
last
Legolas
turned
,
and
seeing
them
now
far
behind
,
he
spoke
to
Aragorn
.
But
ere
long
it
may
well
come
to
pass
that
Minas
Tirith
is
surrounded
,
and
unless
you
have
the
strength
to
break
a
siege
of
many
powers
,
the
Lord
Denethor
bids
me
say
that
he
judges
that
the
strong
arms
of
the
Rohirrim
would
be
better
within
his
walls
than
without
.
But
you
can
go
with
him
tomorrow
,
if
you
think
you
can
get
more
out
of
him
and
if
he
ll
have
you
.
Mr.
There
s
queer
folk
about
.
But
whither
now
shall
I
go
?
No
Precious
.
’
Yes
,
’
said
Legolas
.
The
hour
of
noon
had
passed
.
_
Barliman
Butterbur
is
the
worthy
keeper
.
We
know
the
Ring
is
no
laughing
matter
;
but
we
are
going
to
do
our
best
to
help
you
against
the
Enemy
.
lauri

They
won
t
hurt
us
will
they
,
nice
little
hobbitses
?
I
let
him
go
;
for
I
had
much
else
to
think
of
at
that
time
,
and
I
still
trusted
the
lore
of
Saruman
.
One
sign
of
change
that
he
soon
had
noticed
was
that
he
could
see
more
in
the
dark
than
any
of
his
companions
,
save
perhaps
Gandalf
.
Sam
,
eager
to
see
more
,
went
now
and
joined
the
guards
.
Frodo
s
spirits
had
risen
for
a
while
after
his
escape
,
and
after
food
and
a
draught
of
the
cordial
;
but
now
a
deep
uneasiness
,
growing
to
dread
,
crept
over
him
again
.
and
the
sound
of
the
shaken
rings
was
like
the
tinkle
of
rain
in
a
pool
.
Come
along
now
!
asked
Merry
;
but
Strider
did
not
answer
,
and
seemed
to
be
lost
in
thought
.
’
Good
bye
,
for
the
present
,
Bilbo
.
The
crack
by
which
he
had
laid
himself
had
closed
together
,
so
that
not
a
chink
could
be
seen
.
Then
the
echoes
died
as
suddenly
as
a
flame
blown
out
by
a
dark
wind
,
and
the
enemy
advanced
again
.
_
from
Frodo
.
It
is
,
said
Frodo
,
and
you
had
better
give
me
that
letter
at
once
,
and
explain
why
you
never
sent
it
.
Sam
gave
him
a
mouthful
of
water
;
only
one
more
mouthful
remained
.
Wait
a
minute
!
Oh
yes
,
I
know
!
But
I
have
met
my
match
,
and
have
nearly
been
destroyed
.
And
woe
to
them
,
if
we
prove
the
swifter
!
Just
go
and
tell
him
so
!
’
Gandalf
!
Frodo
ran
to
the
eastern
window
,
and
found
himself
looking
into
a
kitchen
garden
grey
with
dew
.
Hoo
now
!
My
dear
old
hobbit
,
you
don’t
allow
for
the
inquisitiveness
of
friends
.
So
you
go
on
,
’
he
cried
.
said
Gimli
,
patting
his
axe
.
The
Man
in
the
Moon
took
another
mug
,
and
then
rolled
beneath
his
chair
;
And
there
he
dozed
and
dreamed
of
ale
,
Till
in
the
sky
the
stars
were
pale
,
and
dawn
was
in
the
air
.
Hm
!
Where’s
old
Barley
?
Fruitless
did
I
call
the
victory
of
the
Last
Alliance
?
At
dusk
the
Company
set
out
,
and
turning
now
half
east
they
steered
their
course
towards
Caradhras
,
which
far
away
still
glowed
faintly
red
in
the
last
light
of
the
vanished
Sun
.
Tom
wagged
his
head
up
and
down
,
and
there
was
a
glint
in
his
eyes
when
he
heard
of
the
Riders
.
It
seemed
too
much
to
hope
that
the
Riders
had
already
lost
their
trail
again
.
Therefore
I
say
to
you
,
lady
:
Stay
!
And
embassies
came
from
many
lands
and
peoples
,
from
the
East
and
the
South
,
and
from
the
borders
of
Mirkwood
,
and
from
Dunland
in
the
west
.
The
world
was
quiet
and
cold
,
as
if
dawn
were
near
.
But
now
the
vision
had
passed
.
And
I
do
not
desire
the
speech
of
living
men
.
said
Sam
.
After
they
had
eaten
and
drunk
,
sitting
upon
the
grass
,
Celeborn
spoke
to
them
again
of
their
journey
,
and
lifting
his
hand
he
pointed
south
to
the
woods
beyond
the
Tongue
.
It
was
that
very
night
of
summer
,
yet
moonless
and
star
less
,
that
Ores
came
on
us
at
unawares
.
_Me_
take
the
Ring
from
_him_
?
Master
Elrond
will
summon
us
all
ere
long
,
I
believe
,
and
then
we
shall
all
hear
many
things
.
They
will
know
all
the
news
now
,
for
they
have
visited
Bill
Ferny
;
and
probably
that
Southerner
was
a
spy
as
well
.
They
stood
silent
,
reluctant
to
make
the
final
parting
,
and
only
slowly
became
aware
that
Tom
was
wishing
them
farewell
,
and
telling
them
to
have
good
heart
and
to
ride
on
till
dark
without
halting
.
Nor
when
the
riddling
words
of
our
dream
were
debated
among
us
,
did
I
think
of
_Isildur
s
Bane_
as
being
this
same
thing
.
Then
are
we
not
to
see
the
merry
young
hobbits
again
?
Cousin
Frodo
has
been
very
close
,
said
Pippin
.
He
could
not
tell
.
Less
sombre
is
their
gear
than
the
others
,
and
they
are
fair
and
gallant
as
Elven
lords
;
and
that
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
in
the
sons
of
Elrond
of
Rivendell
.
I
was
just
running
over
some
of
the
Rhymes
of
Lore
in
my
mind
answered
the
wizard
.
It
may
have
been
only
a
trick
of
the
wind
in
the
cracks
and
gullies
of
the
rocky
wall
,
but
the
sounds
were
those
of
shrill
cries
,
and
wild
howls
of
laughter
.
Bergil
was
with
him
,
and
he
also
was
downcast
;
for
his
father
was
to
march
leading
a
company
of
the
Men
of
the
City
:
he
could
not
rejoin
the
Guard
until
his
case
was
judged
.
Hola
!
How
do
the
side
and
shoulder
feel
now
?
But
it
was
years
ago
.
said
Aragorn
.
But
I
have
never
heard
this
one
.
Faramir
smiled
grimly
.
These
trees
do
shift
.
But
I
do
not
know
yet
exactly
where
we
are
.
With
that
the
three
hunters
plunged
into
the
forest
of
Fangorn
.
What
is
your
father
?
Our
scouts
have
gained
no
news
of
him
,
and
the
enemy
fills
all
the
valley
behind
us
.
’
To
tell
the
truth
,
he
was
very
reluctant
to
start
,
now
that
it
had
come
to
the
point
:
Bag
End
seemed
a
more
desirable
residence
than
it
had
for
years
,
and
he
wanted
to
savour
as
much
as
he
could
of
his
last
summer
in
the
Shire
.
He
had
a
pocket
full
of
them
:
a
parting
present
from
Nob
and
Bob
.
Then
they
gasped
.
At
times
the
whole
valley
echoed
.
There
it
went
again
from
another
place
!
Follow
me
,
and
keep
your
eyes
open
!
His
hands
were
cold
and
his
brow
damp
.
What
a
pity
there
are
so
few
of
us
!
He
plunged
off
in
the
direction
of
the
call
,
and
found
himself
going
steeply
uphill
.
Merry
looked
round
:
he
had
forgotten
the
war
,
and
all
the
world
beside
,
and
many
hours
it
seemed
since
the
king
rode
to
his
fall
,
though
in
truth
it
was
only
a
little
while
.
Boromir
held
out
long
against
this
choice
;
but
when
it
became
plain
that
Frodo
would
follow
Aragorn
,
wherever
he
went
,
he
gave
in
.
They
can
move
very
quickly
,
if
they
are
angry
.
The
Bridge
is
near
.
And
Orcs
,
they
were
useful
slaves
,
but
he
had
them
in
plenty
.
It
had
slipped
from
Isildur’s
hand
and
betrayed
him
;
then
when
a
chance
came
it
caught
poor
Deagol
,
and
he
was
murdered
;
and
after
that
Gollum
,
and
it
had
devoured
him
.
Sam
got
up
.
As
the
road
climbed
upwards
Frodo
s
spirits
rose
a
little
;
but
he
still
felt
oppressed
,
and
still
at
times
he
heard
,
or
thought
he
heard
,
away
behind
the
Company
and
beyond
the
fall
and
patter
of
their
feet
,
a
following
footstep
that
was
not
an
echo
.
Come
back
!
This
at
least
is
plain
:
the
evil
of
the
Ring
is
already
at
work
even
in
the
Company
,
and
the
Ring
must
leave
them
before
it
does
more
harm
.
Sunlight
was
still
shining
in
the
sky
,
but
long
shadows
reached
over
Isengard
:
grey
ruins
falling
into
darkness
.
Across
the
waste
they
saw
riders
picking
their
way
;
they
were
coming
from
the
north
side
,
and
already
they
were
drawing
near
to
Orthanc
.
’
I
wish
we
could
get
away
!
It
goes
hard
parting
with
anything
I
brought
out
of
the
Elf
country
.
They
would
forbid
his
entry
,
or
his
escape
.
Master
knows
,
said
Gollum
with
a
sidelong
glance
at
Frodo
.
Then
Treebeard
praised
all
their
deeds
,
of
which
he
seemed
to
have
full
knowledge
;
and
at
last
he
stopped
and
looked
long
at
Gandalf
.
They
came
at
last
to
a
white
bridge
,
and
crossing
found
the
great
gates
of
the
city
:
they
faced
south
west
,
set
between
the
ends
of
the
encircling
wall
that
here
overlapped
,
and
they
were
tall
and
strong
,
and
hung
with
many
lamps
.
Lonely
men
are
we
,
Rangers
of
the
wild
,
hunters
but
hunters
ever
of
the
servants
of
the
Enemy
;
for
they
are
found
in
many
places
,
not
in
Mordor
only
.
cried
Gimli
.
And
they
ll
say
:
Yes
,
that
s
one
of
my
favourite
stories
.
I
must
hold
the
narrow
way
.
Gr
ma
shall
ride
too
.
See
,
lads
,
he
said
,
next
time
this
young
varmint
sets
foot
on
my
land
,
you
can
eat
him
.
Of
the
tales
that
we
have
heard
this
day
the
tale
of
Frodo
was
most
strange
to
me
.
The
Winged
Messenger
!
Even
now
it
will
be
dark
before
we
can
reach
the
Ferry
.
Suddenly
a
great
horse
came
striding
up
,
like
a
flash
of
silver
.
Yet
at
the
last
Beren
was
slain
by
the
Wolf
that
came
from
the
gates
of
Angband
,
and
he
died
in
the
arms
of
Tinuviel
.
And
I
learned
also
that
he
had
possessed
it
long
.
Had
he
been
smitten
by
some
dart
of
the
Nazg
l
,
as
you
thought
,
he
would
have
died
that
night
.
I
should
dearly
like
to
see
the
old
fellow
again
,
he
said
.
You
won
t
escape
by
skulking
here
.
said
Gandalf
.
Those
who
pass
the
gates
of
Barad
dur
do
not
return
.
and
so
together
they
still
went
on
.
Aye
,
we
will
,
’
said
Gimli
.
’
said
Gandalf
,
looking
in
through
the
window
,
which
was
near
the
ground
.
’
But
what
has
one
of
the
Big
People
got
to
do
with
us
?
he
repeated
,
and
for
a
moment
doubt
and
fear
shook
him
.
Pass
them
by
!
Gandalf
was
gazing
up
,
his
arms
out
and
downwards
,
stiff
,
his
hands
clenched
.
Its
white
light
quickened
swiftly
,
and
the
shadows
under
the
dark
arch
fled
.
We
drove
them
off
after
some
time
;
they
were
many
and
fierce
,
but
they
came
from
over
the
mountains
,
and
were
unused
to
the
woods
.
Unnoticed
a
Rider
came
up
and
spoke
softly
in
the
hobbit
s
ear
.
said
Bilbo
.
’
I
never
thought
no
such
thing
,
’
answered
Sam
,
in
no
mood
for
jest
.
I
should
have
liked
to
see
it
again
.
said
a
voice
above
him
.
Pippin
was
recovering
.
And
he
turned
and
looked
away
to
the
North
under
the
great
stars
,
and
then
he
fell
silent
and
spoke
no
more
while
the
night
s
journey
lasted
.
And
all
the
host
and
all
the
people
cried
_yea_
with
one
voice
.
Meanwhile
men
busied
themselves
about
the
cave
,
quietly
and
in
orderly
quickness
.
’
Then
tell
us
some
other
tale
of
the
old
days
,
’
begged
Sam
;
a
tale
about
the
Elves
before
the
fading
time
.
I
am
old
,
and
fear
no
peril
any
more
.
He
looked
down
at
Sam
,
who
was
snoring
gently
.
Before
his
feet
the
highest
ridge
of
the
Ephel
D
ath
fell
steeply
in
great
cliffs
down
into
a
dark
trough
,
on
the
further
side
of
which
there
rose
another
ridge
,
much
lower
,
its
edge
notched
and
jagged
with
crags
like
fangs
that
stood
out
black
against
the
red
light
behind
them
:
it
was
the
grim
Morgai
,
the
inner
ring
of
the
fences
of
the
land
.
Cotton
.
’
But
the
wearing
is
slow
in
Lorien
,
’
said
Frodo
.
I
am
with
you
,
Gandalf
!
Did
you
not
hear
me
,
Gloin
?
The
bracken
cracked
and
rustled
,
as
he
twisted
and
turned
.
And
one
that
is
long
and
strong
and
light
.
Enter
the
boats
!
Come
along
!
There
live
still
those
of
whom
Luthien
was
the
foremother
,
and
it
is
said
that
her
line
shall
never
fail
.
At
last
when
Frodo
roused
himself
and
spoke
of
eating
and
making
ready
for
yet
another
effort
,
he
asked
the
question
that
was
troubling
him
most
.
Tugging
at
Frodo
s
sleeve
,
he
pointed
towards
the
path
;
but
Frodo
would
not
move
.
He
waved
his
skinny
arm
towards
the
darkling
mountains
.
I
have
been
dreaming
.
He
is
running
now
as
fast
as
the
swiftest
horse
could
gallop
,
answered
Gandalf
;
but
that
is
not
fast
for
him
.
The
morning
came
after
the
day
of
battle
,
and
it
was
fair
with
light
clouds
and
the
wind
turning
westward
.
Bilbo
and
of
Gandalf
)
.
It
was
fashioned
by
the
builders
of
old
,
who
smoothed
the
Ring
of
Isengard
,
and
yet
it
seemed
a
thing
not
made
by
the
craft
of
Men
,
but
riven
from
the
bones
of
the
earth
in
the
ancient
torment
of
the
hills
.
Thereupon
the
herb
master
entered
.
Suddenly
Gimli
,
who
had
pressed
on
ahead
,
called
back
to
them
.
The
night
deepened
.
said
Haldir
.
Arrows
skipped
and
snapped
harmlessly
about
the
triple
hide
of
his
flanks
.
Where
all
had
looked
so
shabby
and
grey
before
,
the
wood
now
gleamed
with
rich
browns
,
and
with
the
smooth
black
greys
of
bark
like
polished
leather
.
Here
in
the
northward
regions
were
the
mines
and
forges
,
and
the
musterings
of
long
planned
war
;
and
here
the
Dark
Power
,
moving
its
armies
like
pieces
on
the
board
,
was
gathering
them
together
.
There
the
others
must
take
refuge
.
No
,
said
Frodo
.
Still
round
the
corner
we
may
meet
A
sudden
tree
or
standing
stone
That
none
have
seen
but
we
alone
.
The
waxing
moon
was
riding
in
the
West
,
and
the
shadows
of
the
rocks
were
black
.
The
clothes
will
be
the
easiest
part
.
You
say
the
ring
is
dangerous
,
far
more
dangerous
than
I
guess
.
I
know
many
;
but
to
do
things
of
that
kind
rightly
requires
time
,
and
even
then
the
door
can
be
broken
by
strength
.
cried
Pippin
,
springing
up
.
Do
you
know
,
Sam
,
he
said
at
length
,
the
beastly
tree
_threw_
me
in
!
Behind
him
they
walked
in
file
,
threading
their
way
with
care
,
for
under
the
weedy
pools
were
sliding
and
greasy
stones
,
and
footing
was
treacherous
.
How
are
you
going
to
get
through
this
?
Gandalf
stood
before
the
door
of
Orthanc
and
beat
on
it
with
his
staff
.
It
was
an
orc
weapon
,
he
said
,
holding
it
gingerly
,
and
looking
with
disgust
at
the
carved
handle
:
it
had
been
shaped
like
a
hideous
head
with
squinting
eyes
and
leering
mouth
.
I
was
pondering
the
messages
once
again
.
All
my
hopes
are
ruined
,
but
I
would
not
share
yours
.
The
new
Chief
evidently
had
means
of
getting
news
.
You
have
found
it
,
said
omer
.
What
a
pity
that
Bilbo
did
not
stab
that
vile
creature
,
when
he
had
a
chance
!
But
soon
Haldir
turned
aside
into
the
trees
and
halted
on
the
bank
of
the
river
under
their
shadows
.
It
turned
out
later
that
only
one
horse
had
been
actually
stolen
.
Grief
at
last
wholly
overcame
them
,
and
they
wept
long
:
some
standing
and
silent
,
some
cast
upon
the
ground
.
The
third
and
last
time
,
so
he
says
,
is
soon
to
come
,
before
the
ending
of
the
year
.
_
_Adventures
of
Five
Hobbits
.
I
have
waited
on
faltering
feet
long
enough
.
Ask
of
the
North
Wind
news
of
them
the
North
Wind
sends
to
me
!
Heel
!
Yet
in
many
places
it
had
crumbled
away
or
was
crossed
by
gaping
rents
.
The
last
stage
of
the
Quest
was
before
them
.
It
beats
me
why
any
Baggins
of
Hobbiton
should
go
looking
for
a
wife
away
there
in
Buckland
,
where
folks
are
so
queer
.
The
leaves
hung
silently
again
on
stiff
branches
.
Their
hearts
were
heavy
;
for
it
was
a
fair
place
,
and
it
had
become
like
home
to
them
,
though
they
could
not
count
the
days
and
nights
that
they
had
passed
there
.
And
there
were
always
too
few
children
in
this
city
;
but
now
there
are
none
save
some
young
lads
that
will
not
depart
,
and
may
find
some
task
to
do
:
my
own
son
is
one
of
them
.
The
face
of
Elrond
was
ageless
,
neither
old
nor
young
,
though
in
it
was
written
the
memory
of
many
things
both
glad
and
sorrowful
.
I
was
hard
put
to
it
indeed
:
such
light
and
flame
cannot
have
been
seen
on
Weathertop
since
the
war
beacons
of
old
.
But
we
did
not
realize
what
that
would
mean
.
Mrs
.
He
remembered
that
smell
:
the
fragrance
of
Ithilien
.
But
at
the
last
when
the
month
of
May
was
drawing
near
the
Captains
of
the
West
set
out
again
;
and
they
went
aboard
ship
with
all
their
men
,
and
they
sailed
from
Cair
Andros
down
Anduin
to
Osgiliath
;
and
there
they
remained
for
one
day
;
and
the
day
after
they
came
to
the
green
fields
of
the
Pelennor
and
saw
again
the
white
towers
under
tall
Mindolluin
,
the
City
of
the
Men
of
Gondor
,
last
memory
of
Westernesse
,
that
had
passed
through
the
darkness
and
fire
to
a
new
day
.
said
Faramir
,
but
without
anger
.
Then
you
will
kill
_gorg
n_
and
drive
away
bad
dark
with
bright
iron
,
and
Wild
Men
can
go
back
to
sleep
in
the
wild
woods
.
he
said
.
And
now
I
really
must
be
starting
,
or
somebody
else
will
catch
me
.
Tomorrow
we
must
journey
by
day
again
.
Raising
himself
on
one
arm
he
looked
,
and
saw
now
in
the
pale
light
that
they
were
in
a
kind
of
passage
which
behind
them
turned
a
corner
.
Ai
!
And
he
commanded
that
his
banner
should
be
furled
;
and
he
did
off
the
Star
of
the
North
Kingdom
and
gave
it
to
the
keeping
of
the
sons
of
Elrond
.
Then
he
crept
back
to
Frodo
.
I
ve
lugged
my
cooking
gear
all
the
way
from
the
last
camp
,
and
what
use
has
it
been
?
Back
to
the
hall
!
Tell
me
of
Boromir
my
brother
,
and
of
old
Mithrandir
,
and
of
the
fair
people
of
Lothl
rien
.
O
Kheled
zaram
fair
and
wonderful
!
Trapped
in
the
end
!
They
could
all
see
the
black
specks
,
but
neither
Frodo
nor
Merry
could
make
out
their
shapes
for
certain
;
yet
something
told
them
that
there
,
far
below
,
were
Black
Riders
assembling
on
the
Road
beyond
the
foot
of
the
hill
.
Frodo
.
It
was
loftier
and
far
longer
than
the
one
in
which
they
had
slept
.
’
No
indeed
,
’
he
answered
.
What
have
I
done
?
In
his
hand
still
And
ril
gleamed
,
and
the
terror
of
the
sword
for
a
while
held
back
the
enemy
,
as
one
by
one
all
who
could
gain
the
stair
passed
up
towards
the
gate
.
I
have
been
dream
ing
.
Five
days
ere
I
set
out
on
this
venture
,
eleven
days
ago
at
about
this
hour
of
the
day
,
I
heard
the
blowing
of
that
horn
:
from
the
northward
it
seemed
,
but
dim
,
as
if
it
were
but
an
echo
in
the
mind
.
Yet
maybe
there
is
now
more
hope
in
your
search
,
said
Aragorn
.
But
Treebeard
shook
his
head
and
said
:
It
is
far
to
go
.
Yes
,
they
will
come
.
he
said
.
That
is
his
purpose
.
Now
I
can
take
a
night’s
rest
,
the
first
since
I
have
forgot
ten
when
.
There
was
a
bellow
,
and
the
foot
jerked
back
,
nearly
wrenching
Sting
from
Frodo
s
arm
.
Let
us
find
a
path
down
to
the
fields
as
quick
as
may
be
.
’
With
that
he
picked
up
his
lilies
,
and
then
with
a
beckoning
wave
of
his
hand
went
hopping
and
dancing
along
the
path
eastward
,
still
singing
loudly
and
nonsensically
.
I
have
seen
an
eagle
high
and
far
off
:
the
last
time
was
three
days
ago
,
above
the
Emyn
Muil
.
No
,
I
did
not
find
them
,
said
Gandalf
.
The
eastern
arch
will
probably
prove
to
be
the
way
that
we
must
take
;
but
before
we
make
up
our
minds
we
ought
to
look
about
us
.
In
the
dark
at
the
rear
,
grim
and
silent
,
walked
Aragorn
.
Tom
Bombadil
burst
out
laughing
.
Sam
was
snoring
at
his
side
long
before
he
himself
closed
his
eyes
.
For
some
while
he
climbed
,
not
caring
which
way
he
went
,
until
he
came
to
a
grassy
place
.
We
must
have
a
look
and
see
what
the
hammer
and
the
anvil
have
done
to
you
.
More
were
still
coming
in
from
outlying
farms
.
All
the
same
,
I
wish
it
was
over
for
good
or
ill
.
Sam
turned
quickly
.
Then
I
came
back
here
,
and
here
I
have
been
.
If
the
return
to
Iarwain
be
thought
too
dangerous
,
then
flight
to
the
S
a
is
now
fraught
with
gravest
peril
.
It
is
long
since
any
of
my
own
folk
journeyed
hither
back
to
the
land
whence
we
wandered
in
ages
long
ago
,
said
Legolas
,
but
we
hear
that
L
rien
is
not
yet
deserted
,
for
there
is
a
secret
power
here
that
holds
evil
from
the
land
.
Let
them
sail
!
O
!
Sam
looked
back
and
found
that
Frodo
had
lagged
again
.
Goldberry
!
To
his
amazement
he
found
that
Sam
was
asleep
.
Then
he
lifted
his
head
and
peered
cautiously
above
one
of
the
great
roots
.
Frodo
began
to
feel
restless
,
and
the
old
paths
seemed
too
well
trodden
.
He
knows
something
,
that’s
plain
,
and
more
than
I
like
;
but
it’s
no
reason
why
we
should
let
him
go
leading
us
out
into
some
dark
place
far
from
help
,
as
he
puts
it
.
Let
them
see
!
And
that
message
brought
me
hope
.
Some
were
pointing
back
away
south
,
and
some
were
pointing
eastward
.
No
,
after
all
I
believe
your
plan
is
probably
the
best
.
He
looked
about
,
but
there
seemed
nowhere
even
for
an
animal
to
crawl
into
in
this
dismal
country
.
The
letters
are
Elvish
,
of
an
ancient
mode
,
but
the
language
is
that
of
Mordor
,
which
I
will
not
utter
here
.
We
lay
on
top
of
a
pile
of
stone
,
and
could
see
nothing
beyond
it
.
Frodo
.
I
got
it
all
wrong
!
But
Sam
did
not
put
it
on
;
for
even
as
he
clasped
it
to
his
breast
,
an
orc
came
clattering
down
.
Please
remember
,
said
one
of
them
,
that
the
name
Baggins
must
not
be
mentioned
.
Lurking
by
a
stagnant
mere
,
peering
in
the
water
as
the
dark
eve
fell
,
I
caught
him
,
Gollum
.
She
shone
like
a
window
of
glass
upon
a
far
hill
in
the
westering
sun
,
or
as
a
remote
lake
seen
from
a
mountain
:
a
crystal
fallen
in
the
lap
of
the
land
.
Well
,
it
can
t
be
helped
.
’
After
only
a
brief
rest
they
started
on
their
way
again
.
Gandalf
,
sir
!
It
commands
a
wide
view
all
round
;
and
there
we
shall
have
a
chance
to
look
about
us
.
There
was
a
silence
again
for
a
while
.
I
do
;
and
I
remember
more
too
.
I
will
go
now
to
my
pyre
.
Gandalf
stood
at
Frodo
s
side
and
looked
out
under
his
hand
.
After
a
while
he
spoke
again
.
And
I
expect
that
you
are
all
as
weary
as
I
am
,
or
wearier
.
Then
what
would
you
have
me
do
?
But
I
will
be
content
,
if
only
Legolas
here
shares
my
blindness
.
And
I
wondered
how
you
knew
,
said
Frodo
.
The
next
day
the
hills
rose
still
higher
and
steeper
before
them
,
and
they
were
forced
to
turn
away
northwards
out
of
their
course
.
But
all
the
same
,
’
he
added
with
a
shamefaced
laugh
,
I
am
terrified
of
him
and
his
dogs
.
They
heard
eerie
noises
in
the
darkness
round
them
.
Gently
they
laid
owyn
upon
soft
pillows
;
but
the
king
s
body
they
covered
with
a
great
cloth
of
gold
,
and
they
bore
torches
about
him
,
and
their
flames
,
pale
in
the
sunlight
,
were
fluttered
by
the
wind
.
Go
on
?
There
he
was
joined
by
many
others
who
had
watched
the
race
and
the
rescue
from
the
high
walls
.
Ever
up
now
we
went
,
until
we
came
to
the
Endless
Stair
.
It
was
already
night
when
at
last
they
halted
and
made
their
camp
under
some
stunted
alder
trees
by
the
shores
of
the
stream
.
You
could
not
hide
the
fact
that
Boromir
did
not
lead
the
Company
from
Moria
,
and
that
there
was
one
among
you
of
high
honour
who
was
coming
to
Minas
Tirith
;
and
that
he
had
a
famous
sword
.
Then
do
not
be
too
eager
to
deal
out
death
in
judge
ment
.
The
path
seemed
miles
long
.
In
any
case
we
did
not
kill
him
:
he
is
very
old
and
very
wretched
.
and
there
was
none
to
row
or
steer
it
.
Very
carefully
!
There
came
at
last
a
dreadful
nightfall
;
and
even
as
the
Captains
of
the
West
drew
near
to
the
end
of
the
living
lands
,
the
two
wanderers
came
to
an
hour
of
blank
despair
.
The
only
plan
that
is
proposed
to
us
is
that
a
halfling
should
walk
blindly
into
Mordor
and
offer
the
Enemy
every
chance
of
recapturing
it
for
himself
.
Well
,
answered
Merry
slowly
.
It
is
perilous
to
study
too
deeply
the
arts
of
the
Enemy
,
for
good
or
for
ill
.
I
think
all
will
be
well
now
,
answered
Gandalf
.
