I
knew
that
you
were
coming
,
but
I
was
at
work
up
the
valley
;
there
is
much
still
to
be
done
.
They
will
sing
that
,
and
other
songs
of
the
Blessed B-LOC
Realm   I-LOC
,
many
times
tonight
.
But
now
the
dark
swooping
shadows
were
aware
of
the
newcomer
.
Then
he
remembered
where
he
was
and
lay
down
again
.
Then
he
sat
in
the
largest
chair
and
called
the
hobbits
to
gather
round
him
.
It
rose
up
nearly
to
his
neck
before
he
got
too
far
away
for
me
to
see
him
.
Smagol   B-PER
doesn't
know
,
answered
Gollum   B-PER
.
Men
believed
that
the
Orcs
whom
they
had
slain
were
buried
there
;
but
whether
those
who
had
fled
into
the
wood
were
with
them
,
none
could
say
,
for
no
man
ever
set
foot
upon
that
hill
.
Courage
is
found
in
unlikely
places
,
said
Gildor   B-PER
.
No
,
sir
.
Here
and
there
old
trees
had
been
cut
or
broken
down
,
and
large
rocks
cloven
or
heaved
aside
to
make
a
way
.
The
leaves
of
trees
were
glistening
,
and
every
twig
was
dripping
;
the
grass
was
grey
with
cold
dew
.
Their
weapons
were
taken
from
them
,
and
they
were
roped
together
,
and
marched
off
to
an
empty
hut
that
they
had
built
themselves
,
and
there
they
were
tied
hand
and
foot
,
and
locked
up
under
guard
.
The
last
pages
are
for
you
.
Well
,
I
call
that
very
queer
,
and
indeed
disturbing
,
’
said
Frodo   B-PER
to
himself
,
as
he
walked
towards
his
companions
.
How
long
have
you
known
all
this
?
Go
back
!
Don't
!
Their
land
was
originally
unprotected
from
the
East
;
but
on
that
side
they
had
built
a
hedge
:
the
High    B-LOC
Hay I-LOC
.
Fair
River
daughter
!
You
will
come
to
the
rapids
of
Sarn    B-LOC
Gebir   I-LOC
,
and
maybe
at
last
to
the
great
falls   B-LOC
of  I-LOC
Rauros  I-LOC
where
the
River
thunders
down
from
Nen B-LOC
Hithoel I-LOC
;
and
there
are
other
perils
.
That
may
be
it
.
Tell
us
about
the
Black   B-PER
Riders  I-PER
!
The
Grey    B-PER
Pilgrim I-PER
?
Guard
him
well
,
while
I
am
away
!
Not
even
the
anvils
and
furnaces
of
the
Dwarves
could
do
that
.
And
doughty
Men
too
,
if
I
may
say
it
;
though
lesser
men
with
spades
might
have
served
you
better
.
For
I
have
not
slept
in
such
a
bed
as
this
,
since
I
rode
from
Dunharrow   B-LOC
,
nor
eaten
since
the
dark
before
dawn
.
And
I
am
not
one
either
.
It
will
find
its
way
in
,
and
then
I
shall
drown
.
Why
not
?
For
three
years
after
the
Party
he
had
been
away
.
Far
away
it
seemed
.
And
look
closely
!
They
are
sure
to
have
found
out
which
those
are
.
’
Yet
sworn
word
may
strengthen
quaking
heart
,
’
said
Gimli    B-PER
.
They
would
have
started
earlier
,
only
the
delay
so
plainly
annoyed
the
Shirriff    B-ORG
leader  
.
But
in
metal
work
we
cannot
rival
our
fathers
,
many
of
whose
secrets
are
lost
.
’
said
Frodo   B-PER
,
getting
impatient
with
the
slow
unravelling
of
Butterbur’s   B-PER
thoughts
.
’
I
have
finished
both
now
.
Couldn't
we
sit
here
together
in
the
sun
,
while
it
lasts
?
he
asked
.
Tom   B-PER
can’t
be
always
near
to
open
doors
and
willow
cracks
.
Are
you
trying
to
tell
yourself
you've
got
some
rope
in
your
pocket
?
Grishnkah's B-PER
sword
was
lying
close
at
hand
,
but
it
was
too
heavy
and
clumsy
for
him
to
use
;
so
he
crawled
forward
,
and
finding
the
body
of
the
goblin
he
drew
from
its
sheath
a
long
sharp
knife
.
Time
passed
with
many
cares
,
until
my
doubts
were
awak
ened
again
to
sudden
fear
.
Suddenly
Tom's   B-PER
talk
left
the
woods
and
went
leaping
up
the
young
stream
,
over
bubbling
waterfalls
,
over
pebbles
and
worn
rocks
,
and
among
small
flowers
in
close
grass
and
wet
crannies
,
wandering
at
last
up
on
to
the
Downs   B-LOC
.
Cannot
you
see
him
,
passing
from
tree
to
tree
?
Hobbits
go
home
.
Go
where
you
must
go
,
and
hope
!
Far
off
,
as
in
a
little
picture
drawn
by
elven
fingers
he
saw
the
Lady
Galadriel   B-PER
standing
on
the
grass
in
Lorien  B-LOC
,
and
gifts
were
in
her
hands
.
Anyway
:
there
was
this
Mr.
Frodo   B-PER
left
an
orphan
and
stranded
,
as
you
might
say
,
among
those
queer
Bucklanders B-PER
,
being
brought
up
anyhow
in
Brandy  B-LOC
Hall    I-LOC
.
What
do
you
seek
?
He
will
be
a
hundred
and
thirty
one
!
At
last
the
hobbits
saw
,
rising
dimly
before
them
,
a
steep
dark
land
:
they
had
come
to
the
feet
of
the
mountains
,
and
to
the
green
roots
of
tall
Methedras   B-LOC
.
I'm
here
.
I   
can
see
a
darkness
.
In
Rivendell   B-LOC
there
was
memory
of
ancient
things
;
in
Lorien  B-LOC
the
ancient
things
still
lived
on
in
the
waking
world
.
At
last
they
came
to
The B-LOC
Prancing    I-LOC
Pony    I-LOC
,
and
that
at
least
looked
outwardly
unchanged
;
and
there
were
lights
behind
the
red
curtains
in
the
lower
windows
.
Smeagol B-PER
will
stay
here
:
I
will
stay
here
,
and
the
Yellow  B-PER
Face    I-PER
won't
see
me
.
Tell
us
of
Gil B-PER
galad   I-PER
,
said
Merry   B-PER
suddenly
,
when
he
paused
at
the
end
of
a
story
of
the
Elf B-LOC
Kingdoms    I-LOC
.
It
was
a
bitter
struggle
,
and
the
weariness
is
slow
to
pass
.
Frodo   B-PER
!
And
you
,
Sammie  B-PER
,
don’t
go
ill
treating
my
poor
old
pony
!
Begone
,
and
trouble
me
no
more
!
When
they
came
at
last
to
the
end
of
it
,
Frodo   B-PER
stooped
and
leaned
out
.
Then
they
rested
and
slept
without
fear
upon
the
ground
;
for
their
guides
would
not
permit
them
to
unbind
their
eyes
,
and
they
could
not
climb
.
This
stone
I
gave
to
Celebrian   B-PER
my
daughter
,
and
she
to
hers
;
and
now
it
comes
to
you
as
a
token
of
hope
.
An
exclamation
of
dismay
came
from
the
empty
boat
.
In
that
way
they
would
,
if
all
went
well
,
cut
off
a
great
loop
of
the
Road
,
which
further
on
bent
southwards
to
avoid
the
Midgewater  B-LOC
Marshes I-LOC
.
The
Inn B-LOC
of  I-LOC
Bree    I-LOC
was
still
there
,
however
,
and
the
innkeeper
was
an
important
person
.
What
of
the
Three
Rings
of
the
Elves
?
Light
gleamed
in
a
window
slit
.
But
keep
what
honour
you
may
,
and
do
not
run
!
The
Sun
could
not
watch
me
there
.
No
,
sir
,
of
course
not
.
Twice
Sam B-PER
thought
he
heard
him
speaking
Gandalf's   B-PER
name
.
I
will
go
first
.
said
Aragorn B-PER
,
taking
his
hand
and
kissing
his
brow
.
When
we
leave
here
,
where
there
are
still
a
few
trees
and
bushes
,
each
of
us
should
carry
a
faggot
of
wood
,
as
large
as
he
can
bear
.
No
,
’
said
Gandalf B-PER
,
but
I
can
.
A
deep
loneliness
and
sense
of
loss
was
on
them
.
Such
a
sound
had
not
been
heard
in
those
places
since
Sauron  B-PER
came
to
Middle  B-LOC
earth   I-LOC
.
But
it
was
not
by
design
of
your
own
that
you
became
embroiled
in
them
,
and
so
I
will
not
blame
such
part
as
you
have
played
a
valiant
one
,
I
doubt
not
.
’
That
is
because
you
do
not
understand
and
cannot
imagine
what
lies
ahead
,
’
said
Elrond  B-PER
.
It
is
not
despair
,
for
despair
is
only
for
those
who
see
the
end
beyond
all
doubt
.
Snow
was
thick
on
his
hood
and
shoulders
;
it
was
already
ankle
deep
about
his
boots
.
Sam B-PER
was
silent
,
deep
in
his
memories
.
Some
said
that
it
could
be
seen
,
like
a
great
black
horseman
,
a
dark
shadow
under
the
moon
.
I
have
lost
it
,
Bilbo   B-PER
dear
,
said
Frodo   B-PER
.
We
will
stay
here
for
a
while
.
He
saw
that
riders
away
eastward
were
already
level
with
the
Orcs
,
galloping
over
the
plain
.
Ah
!
I
tried
to
save
the
Shire   B-LOC
,
and
it
has
been
saved
,
but
not
for
me
.
Though
I
m
sure
I
don
t
know
why
he
should
,
sitting
in
his
big
chair
up
in
his
great
castle
,
hundreds
of
miles
away
.
I
knew
the
risk
of
snow
,
though
it
seldom
falls
heavily
so
far
south
,
save
high
up
in
the
mountains
.
I
do
not
wish
for
such
triumphs
,
Frodo   B-PER
son
of
Drogo   B-PER
.
’
they
shouted
,
and
kept
on
repeating
it
in
chorus
,
seeming
reluctant
to
follow
their
own
advice
.
Yes
,
said
Aragorn B-PER
,
we
shall
all
need
the
endurance
of
Dwarves
.
Calling
me
early
aren
t
you
,
Sam B-PER
?
Your
friends
sprang
aside
,
off
the
road
,
or
they
would
have
been
ridden
down
.
Boats
of
the
Elves
would
not
sink
,
maybe
,
he
said
,
but
that
does
not
say
that
we
should
come
through
Sarn    B-LOC
Gebir   I-LOC
alive
.
Farewell
,
and
may
you
find
what
you
seek
!
Saruman B-PER
kept
enough
wisdom
not
to
trust
his
Orcs
.
They
have
not
found
the
Ring
.
When
the
Elves
passed
westward
,
Tom B-PER
was
here
already
,
before
the
seas
were
bent
.
But
what
is
the
good
of
such
honour
?
Gollum  B-PER
watched
every
morsel
from
hand
to
mouth
,
like
an
expectant
dog
by
a
diner
s
chair
.
One
only
of
us
is
an
Elf
,
Legolas B-PER
from
the
Woodland    B-LOC
Realm   I-LOC
in
distant
Mirkwood    B-LOC
.
Many
leagues
,
said
he
,
but
not
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
.
now
!
said
Gandalf B-PER
quietly
as
he
rode
by
Frodo's B-PER
side
.
A
few
of
the
riders
appeared
to
be
bowmen
,
skilled
at
shooting
from
a
running
horse
.
I
do
not
counsel
you
to
leave
the
City
all
unmanned
.
The
wildest
imaginings
that
dark
rumour
had
ever
suggested
to
the
hobbits
fell
altogether
short
of
the
actual
dread
and
wonder
of
Moria   B-LOC
.
He
surveyed
the
green
lawn
,
quickly
but
thoroughly
,
stooping
often
to
the
earth
.
O
my
poor
hands
,
gollum  B-PER
!
Back
to
the
boats
!
Sit
on
the
grass
and
wait
for
the
Whiteskins  B-ORG  
to
join
the
picnic
?
Therein
lies
all
our
hope
.
I
ll
put
red
maggot
holes
in
your
belly
first
.
But
Theoden B-PER
would
not
listen
to
him
,
and
he
went
away
.
The
hobbits
could
hear
no
movements
,
and
after
listening
for
a
while
they
set
off
eastward
at
a
steady
pace
.
I
wish
I
had
waited
for
Gandalf B-PER
,
Frodo   B-PER
muttered
.
The
grots
and
rocky
walls
were
already
starred
with
saxifrages
and
stonecrops
.
So
may
other
things
in
which
you
still
have
trust
.
That
was
on
Wednesday
the
eve
of
the
Party
.
But
Shire   B-LOC
folk
have
been
so
comfortable
so
long
they
don't
know
what
to
do
.
Then
he
paid
Frodo   B-PER
a
brief
visit
,
and
after
taking
a
good
look
at
him
he
went
off
again
.
Go
carefully
with
the
water
,
too
!
’
Has
Gandalf B-PER
told
you
nothing
?
I
asked
.
Only
some
bundle
of
oddments
,
perhaps
,
after
all
,
he
thought
with
a
strange
sense
of
relief
;
but
he
did
not
put
the
bundle
down
again
.
At
once
there
was
great
jostling
and
cursing
as
each
troop
tried
to
get
first
to
the
gate
and
the
ending
of
their
march
.
Gildor  B-PER
said
you
should
take
them
as
was
willing
,
and
you
can't
deny
it
.
Still
,
I
daresay
I
could
get
together
a
fair
company
of
our
younger
folks
if
I
could
make
them
understand
the
need
:
if
I
could
rouse
them
:
we
are
not
a
hasty
folk
.
The
morning
was
passing
towards
noon
,
and
still
the
Company
wandered
and
scrambled
in
a
barren
country
of
red
stones
.
Stand
still
!
’
They
went
along
the
lane
,
until
they
saw
the
thatched
roofs
of
a
large
house
and
farm
buildings
peeping
out
among
the
trees
ahead
.
Here
let
us
hope
that
the
virtue
of
the
Elves
will
keep
us
tonight
from
the
peril
that
comes
behind
.
he
boomed
,
when
he
saw
them
.
said
Pippin  B-PER
.
Still
every
little
is
a
gain
.
But
as
for
your
business
’
He
got
up
and
went
to
the
door
,
opened
it
quickly
and
looked
out
.
I
release
you
from
my
service
,
but
not
from
my
friendship
.
What
are
all
these
queer
goings
on
?
For
of
Beren   B-PER
and
Luthien B-PER
was
born
Dior    B-PER
Thingol’s   I-PER
heir
;
and
of
him
Elwing  B-PER
the
White
whom
Earendil    B-PER
wedded
,
he
that
sailed
his
ship
out
of
the
mists
of
the
world
into
the
seas
of
heaven
with
the
Silmaril
upon
his
brow
.
They
had
drawn
their
knives
and
swords
,
but
hesitated
to
attack
Ugluk   B-PER
.
But
the
Ents    
could
say
more
on
their
side
,
if
they
had
time
!
said
Boromir B-PER
,
that
they
will
buy
their
lives
with
horses
.
said
Aragorn B-PER
.
Wild
Men
say
many
things
he
said
.
Then
I
heard
Bilbo's B-PER
strange
story
of
how
he
had
won
it
,
and
I
could
not
believe
it
.
A
man
came
and
beckoned
to
the
hobbits
,
and
took
them
to
the
recess
at
the
back
of
the
cave
.
Not
very
near
,
and
yet
too
near
,
it
seems
.
Y

.
It
is
but
a
feint
,
said
Aragorn B-PER
;
and
its
chief
purpose
,
I
deem
,
was
rather
to
draw
us
on
by
a
false
guess
of
our
Enemyes
weakness
than
to
do
us
much
hurt
,
yet
.
Help
!
’
he
cried
.
Even
in
the
Shire   B-LOC
there
are
some
as
like
minding
other
folk
s
business
and
talking
big
.
I
have
known
strong
warriors
of
the
Big
People
who
would
quickly
have
been
overcome
by
that
splinter
,
which
you
bore
for
seventeen
days
.
So
!
Well
,
here
we
are
and
all
ready
,
said
Merry   B-PER
;
but
where
are
the
Doors
?
It
was
after
nightfall
when
,
wet
and
tired
,
the
travellers
came
at
last
to
the
Brandywine  B-LOC
,
and
they
found
the
way
barred
.
When
they
had
stood
silent
for
a
time
beside
the
king
,
Imrahil B-PER
said
:
Where
is
the
Steward B-PER
?
You'd
have
to
get
Strider B-PER
,
Aragorn B-PER
that
is
,
or
old
Mr.
Bilbo   B-PER
,
for
that
.
Now
s
a
chance
to
show
your
quality
.
It
s
not
like
me
,
somehow
,
if
you
understand
.
He
may
watch
all
roads
,
likely
and
unlikely
.
But
Smeagol B-PER
doesn't
mind
.
Yes
,
’
he
answered
.
And
dimly
to
be
seen
were
many
rows
of
tables
,
carved
of
marble
;
and
upon
each
table
lay
a
sleeping
form
,
hands
folded
,
head
pillowed
upon
stone
.
And
I
can
t
wear
orc
mail
over
all
my
clothes
,
can
I
?
Before
they
walked
away
,
they
bowed
low
.
There
Anduin  B-PER
,
going
in
a
wide
knee
about
the
hills
of
Emyn    B-LOC
Arnen   I-LOC
in
South   B-LOC
Ithilien    I-LOC
,
bent
sharply
west
,
and
the
out
wall
rose
upon
its
very
brink
;
and
beneath
it
lay
the
quays
and
landings
of
the
Harlond
for
craft
that
came
upstream
from
the
southern
fiefs
.
cried
Sam B-PER
.
Slowly
the
dawn
grew
to
a
pale
light
,
diffused
and
shadowless
.
It
is
howling
with
wolf
voices
.
Nowhere
are
there
any
men
so
friendly
to
us
as
the
Men
of
Dale    B-LOC
.
Night
under
Night
is
flown
,
and
the
Gate
is
open
!
Merry   B-PER
and
Pippin  B-PER
climbed
the
gate
,
and
the
hobbits
fled
.
When
they
came
to
the
arch
Gandalf B-PER
went
through
,
signing
to
them
to
wait
.
He
was
taking
a
far
greater
risk
than
he
knew
;
but
Frodo   B-PER
was
too
much
occupied
with
his
burden
and
with
the
struggle
in
his
mind
to
debate
,
and
almost
too
hopeless
to
care
.
They
ate
a
very
frugal
supper
(
for
hobbits
)
,
and
then
went
on
again
.
I
wish
then
to
learn
from
you
more
of
it
;
for
what
concerns
Boromir B-PER
concerns
me
.
All
right
!
Here
is
the
Mirror  B-LOC
of  I-LOC
Galadriel   I-LOC   
,
’
she
said
.
They
called
for
more
ale
,
and
began
to
shout
:
Let
s
have
it
again
,
master
!
But
where
is
Aragorn B-PER
?
Of
what
they
brought
to
light
the
Orcs
have
gathered
nearly
all
,
and
given
it
in
tribute
to
Sauron  B-PER
,
who
covets
it
.
asked
Frodo   B-PER
.
The
fourteenth
of
the
New
Year
,
said
Gandalf B-PER
;
or
if
you
like
,
the
eighth
day
of
April
in
the
Shire   B-LOC
reckoning
.
Hobbits
!
He
was
fully
awake
now
,
and
the
memory
of
his
journey
was
returning
:
the
disastrous
short
cut’
through
the
Old B-LOC
Forest  I-LOC
;
the
accident’
at
The B-LOC
Prancing    I-LOC
Pony    I-LOC
.
There
was
no
sign
of
enemies
nor
of
any
challenge
.
No
.
Twas
the
eyes
as
made
me
sit
up
,
so
to
speak
.
Will
you
be
wanting
anything
to
drink
,
masters
?
How
then
do
you
read
this
riddle
?
To
the
end
of
the
journey
in
the
end
,
’
said
Gandalf B-PER
.
And
that
may
well
befall
,
said
Gimli   B-PER
.
’
Whether
because
of
Strider’s   B-PER
skill
or
for
some
other
reason
,
they
saw
no
sign
and
heard
no
sound
of
any
other
living
thing
all
that
day
:
neither
two
footed
,
except
birds
;
nor
four
footed
,
except
one
fox
and
a
few
squirrels
.
Not
to
evil
,
I
think
.
But
there
is
much
to
read
in
that
book
,
and
I
cannot
claim
to
have
seen
more
than
a
page
or
two
.
Frodo   B-PER
actually
laughed
.
The
other
hobbits
agreed
hopefully
that
it
did
not
,
but
they
all
remained
full
of
suspicion
.
hai
!
Excellent
!
The
stair
was
dark
,
but
on
the
roof
top
the
glare
of
the
Mountain
could
still
be
seen
,
though
it
was
dying
down
now
to
a
sullen
red
.
We
are
coming
to
reaches
of
the
River
that
I
do
not
know
well
:
for
I
have
never
journeyed
by
water
in
these
parts
before
,
not
between
here
and
the
rapids
of
Sarn    B-LOC   
Gebir   I-LOC
.
That
would
not
be
easy
,
even
if
we
were
all
Men
,
said
Boromir B-PER
.
So
the
Company
went
on
their
long
way
,
down
the
wide
hurrying
waters
,
borne
ever
southwards
.
I
ll
look
in
again
later
.
Then
the
watch
upon
the
walls
of
Mordor  B-LOC
slept
,
and
dark
things
crept
back
to
Gorgoroth   B-LOC   
.
Pippin  B-PER
declared
that
Frodo   B-PER
was
looking
twice
the
hobbit
that
he
had
been
.
But
you
won
t
send
him
off
alone
surely
,
Master
?
But
not
the
nice
hobbit
?
Pippin  B-PER
,
said
Sam B-PER
.
Orc
gear
s
no
good
,
said
Sam B-PER
,
waving
his
arms
.
I
will
shorten
the
stirrups
up
to
the
saddle
skins
,
and
you
must
sit
as
tight
as
you
can
.
I
wonder
what
became
of
it
.
How
long
have
you
known
this
?
I
cannot
answer
that
now
,
said
Gandalf B-PER
.
Just
as
nice
a
little
stair
for
that
slinking
Gollum  B-PER
as
we
could
leave
.
Merry   B-PER
slept
until
he
was
roused
by
Legolas B-PER
and
Gimli   B-PER
.
Come
,
Mr.
Frodo   B-PER
,
said
Sam
.
said
the
Elf
in
a
hissing
whisper
,
and
cast
on
to
the
flet
the
rope
ladder
rolled
up
.
I
wish
it
had
never
,
never
,
been
found
.
Wandering
aimlessly
at
first
in
the
wood
,
Frodo   B-PER
found
that
his
feet
were
leading
him
up
towards
the
slopes
of
the
hill
.
There
were
some
that
shook
their
heads
and
thought
this
was
too
much
of
a
good
thing
;
it
seemed
unfair
that
anyone
should
possess
(
apparently
)
perpetual
youth
as
well
as
(
reputedly
)
inexhaustible
wealth
.
A
little
way
off
he
heard
a
harsh
laugh
and
the
tread
of
many
feet
on
the
ground
below
.
Wolf
!
It
is
close
to
the
Road
.
said
Gandalf B-PER
,
shaking
his
head
.
But
soon
Pippin  B-PER
saw
that
all
was
in
fact
well
ordered
:
the
wains
were
moving
in
three
lines
,
one
swifter
drawn
by
horses
;
another
slower
,
great
waggons
with
fair
housings
of
many
colours
,
drawn
by
oxen
;
and
along
the
west
rim
of
the
road
many
smaller
carts
hauled
by
trudging
men
.
Yet
,
Master
Peregrin    B-PER
,
we
have
this
honour
:
ever
we
bear
the
brunt
of
the
chief
hatred
of
the
Dark    B-PER
Lord    I-PER
,
for
that
hatred
comes
down
out
of
the
depths
of
time
and
over
the
deeps
of
the
Sea
.
A
score
or
more
.
Yet
that
was
now
a
day
ago
.
s
had
passed
,
and
was
looking
straight
at
Bilbo   B-PER
when
he
suddenly
reappeared
.
In
that
clear
air
watchmen
on
the
walls
saw
afar
a
new
sight
of
fear
,
and
their
last
hope
left
them
.
said
Gimli   B-PER
.
It
is
rather
a
strange
and
sad
story
,
he
went
on
after
a
pause
.
Great
beasts
drew
it
,
Orcs
surrounded
it
,
and
behind
walked
mountain
trolls
to
wield
it
.
Often
blocked
or
destroyed
by
the
tumults
of
the
Mountain
s
furnaces
,
always
that
road
was
repaired
and
cleaned
again
by
the
labours
of
countless
orcs
.
You
were
very
fond
of
Bilbo   B-PER
were
you
not
?
’
Sam B-PER
muttered
something
inaudible
.
It
will
go
behind
the
hills
soon
,
yess
.
But
you
d
best
ask
Barliman    B-PER
.
He
told
me
that
his
business
with
you
had
gone
well
,
and
that
you
would
be
starting
for
Rivendell   B-LOC   
in
the
last
week
of
September
.
I
wonder
what
he
will
say
?
Is
that
so
?
Before
them
the
mountains
frowned
,
but
their
path
lay
in
a
deep
trough
of
land
and
they
could
see
only
the
higher
shoulders
and
the
far
eastward
peaks
.
Many
of
the
trees
seemed
asleep
,
or
as
unaware
of
him
as
of
any
other
creature
that
merely
passed
by
;
but
some
quivered
,
and
some
raised
up
their
branches
above
his
head
as
he
approached
.
He
sheathed
his
sword
.
It
will
be
quicker
so
.
And
I
hope
he
s
up
to
no
tricks
.
Now
I
see
your
mind
.
Gimli   B-PER
started
and
then
stood
still
as
stone
,
staring
,
while
the
old
man
sprang
up
the
rough
steps
as
nimbly
as
a
goat
.
But
I
don’t
think
you
need
go
alone
.
Sleepy
heads
,
yes
,
sleepy
heads
!
In
a
little
while
they
came
to
the
point
on
the
East
Road
where
they
had
taken
leave
of
Bombadil    B-PER    
;
and
they
hoped
and
half
expected
to
see
him
standing
there
to
greet
them
as
they
went
by
.
Well
,
I
have
rather
a
rascally
look
,
have
I
not
?
I
was
not
sure
of
it
myself
when
I
was
last
here
;
but
the
time
has
come
to
speak
.
Steep
as
a
stair
,
it
looped
backwards
and
forwards
as
it
climbed
.
What
of
the
Three
Rings
of
the
Elves
?
I
used
to
think
that
they
were
things
the
wonderful
folk
of
the
stories
went
out
and
looked
for
,
because
they
wanted
them
,
because
they
were
exciting
and
life
was
a
bit
dull
,
a
kind
of
a
sport
,
as
you
might
say
.
There
he
stood
,
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
and
the
wind
in
his
hair
,
and
looked
down
upon
the
three
hobbits
,
that
had
been
laid
on
their
backs
upon
the
grass
at
the
west
side
of
the
mound
.
Whether
because
of
some
special
keenness
of
sight
,
or
because
of
some
other
sense
,
the
horse
lifted
and
sprang
lightly
over
them
;
but
its
rider
did
not
see
them
,
lying
covered
in
their
elven
cloaks
,
too
crushed
for
the
moment
,
and
too
afraid
to
move
.
I
will
sleep
now
,
’
he
said
;
and
the
Elf
led
him
to
a
bower
beside
Pippin  B-PER
,
and
he
threw
himself
upon
a
bed
and
fell
at
once
into
a
dreamless
slumber
.
At
that
Bilbo   B-PER
opened
an
eye
,
almost
as
if
he
had
heard
.
Must
get
up
,
yes
they
must
!
It
won
t
sound
too
pretty
to
say
you
ve
caught
the
kitten
and
let
the
cat
escape
.
He
soon
found
that
the
thicket
was
closer
and
more
tangled
than
it
had
appeared
.
Later
that
day
the
hobbits
held
a
meeting
of
their
own
in
Bilbo’s B-PER
room
.
The
Sackville   B-PER
Bagginses   I-PER
were
rather
offensive
.
The
morning
is
wearing
away
.
Then
swift
as
a
runner
over
firm
sand
he
shot
away
,
and
quickly
overtaking
the
toiling
men
,
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
he
passed
them
,
and
sped
into
the
distance
,
and
vanished
round
the
rocky
turn
.
Even
reckoned
as
a
lord
and
captain
Saruman B-PER
has
grown
very
strong
.
The
land
had
changed
.
Yet
,
maybe
,
he
would
not
have
done
so
,
and
the
journey
of
Boromir B-PER
was
doomed
.
Frodo   B-PER
,
Mr.
Frodo   B-PER
!
Suddenly
Frodo   B-PER
laughed
:
from
the
covered
basket
he
held
,
the
scent
of
mushrooms
was
rising
.
But
few
marked
what
Isildur B-PER
did
.
Then
he
let
sound
a
great
concourse
of
trumpets
taken
from
the
enemy
;
and
the
Shadow
Host
withdrew
to
the
shore
.
And
the
Dwarf
,
hearing
the
names
given
in
his
own
ancient
tongue
,
looked
up
and
met
her
eyes
;
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
looked
suddenly
into
the
heart
of
an
enemy
and
saw
there
love
and
understanding
.
Not
far
down
the
bank
Strider B-PER
pointed
out
a
stone
in
the
grass
.
Twice
.
What
shall
we
wear
?
None
would
withstand
them
.
For
Radagast    B-PER
knew
no
reason
why
he
should
not
do
as
I
asked
;
and
he
rode
away
towards
Mirkwood    B-LOC
where
he
had
many
friends
of
old
.
In
those
days
the
Companions
of
the
Ring
dwelt
together
in
a
fair
house
with
Gandalf B-PER
,
and
they
went
to
and
fro
as
they
wished
.
I
am
Mr.
Underhill   B-PER
,
if
any
name
must
be
given
.
And
why
should
he
want
such
slaves
?
Man
!
Dangerous
,
and
probably
useless
;
but
it
must
be
done
.
’
And
to
Frodo   B-PER
she
said
:
Farewell
,
Elf
friend
,
it
was
a
merry
meeting
!
Not
much
use
is
it
,
Sam B-PER
?   
I
came
to
Buckland    B-LOC
and
found
it
in
uproar
,
as
busy
as
a
hive
of
ants
that
has
been
stirred
with
a
stick
.
There
were
the
prints
of
orc
feet
in
the
earth
.
Then
the
Nine    B-PER
Riders  I-PER
issued
forth
from
the
gates
of
horror
,
and
we
could
not
withstand
them
.
spilled
and
fed
the
falling
stream
.
A
great
cloud
of
it
was
going
up
far
away
in
the
direction
of
the
Woody   B-LOC
End I-LOC
.
They
had
ridden
for
some
five
hours
and
were
far
out
upon
the
western
plain
,
yet
more
than
half
their
journey
lay
still
before
them
.
Before
he
could
conceal
it
,
they
saw
through
the
mask
the
anguish
of
a
mind
in
doubt
,
loathing
to
stay
and
dreading
to
leave
its
refuge
.
I
do
not
know
for
what
reason
the
Enemy
is
pursuing
you
,
answered
Gildor  B-PER
;
but
I
perceive
that
he
is
strange
indeed
though
that
seems
to
me
.
Got
you
,
Gorbag  B-PER
!
These
Rings
have
a
way
of
being
found
.
The
morning
was
now
far
advanced
.
he
said
.
Your
small
fire
,
of
course
,
would
not
melt
even
ordinary
gold
.
It
is
a
sad
necessity
.
He
stepped
back
shaking
all
over
and
looked
at
the
Lady
.
If
only
they
are
in
a
hurry
and
will
let
a
couple
of
tired
soldiers
alone
and
pass
on
!
May
the
curse
of
Faramir B-PER
bite
that
Gollum  B-PER
and
bite
him
quick
!
Many
fives
of
his
small
kind
.
Now
answer
me
:
whither
would
you
go
?
A
new
hour
comes
.
Would
any
of
you
have
believed
me
till
now
?
They
saw
nothing
more
,
until
they
stumbled
over
the
body
of
Frodo   B-PER
,
lying
as
if
dead
,
face
downwards
on
the
grass
with
his
sword
beneath
him
.
At
his
side    
Pippin  B-PER
lay
dreaming
pleasantly
;
but
a
change
came
over
his
dreams
and
he
turned
and
groaned
.
s
get
their
claws
on
it
,
at
any
rate
I
have
found
a
good
home
for
this
!
Rowan   B-PER
trees
grew
about
it
,
and
in
the
midst
was
a
wide
flat
stone
.
Nice
hobbit
,
come
back
to
poor
Smeagol B-PER
.
Sam B-PER
!
But
I’m
beginning
to
think
it’s
time
we
got
a
sight
of
that
Fiery   B-LOC
Mountain    I-LOC
,
and
saw
the
end
of
the
Road
,
so
to
speak
.
I
have
no
memory
of
this
place
at
all
!
’
said
Glorfindel  B-PER
to
them
,
pouring
for
each
in
turn
a
little
liquor
from
his
silver
studded
flask
of
leather
.
Sam B-PER
!
What
is
it
all
about
?
How
far
is
there
to
go
?
The
boats
were
all
huddled
together
.
Surely
the
time
is
up
?
They
are
made
of
the
fair
tree
lebethron
,
beloved
of
the
woodwrights
of
Gondor  B-LOC
,
and
a
virtue
has
been
set
upon
them
of
finding
and
returning
.
Why
yes
!
All
the
same
,
I
am
not
sure
that
Treebeard   B-PER
is
right
:
I
fancy
he
could
do
some
mischief
still
in
a
small
mean
way
.
Gandalf B-PER
sat
down
again
and
puffed
at
his
pipe
,
as
if
lost
in
thought
.
Then
they
all
fell
silent
,
and
one
by
one
the
hobbits
dropped
off
to
sleep
.
So
it
was
that
Frodo   B-PER
saw
her
whom
few
mortals
had
yet
seen
;
Arwen
,
daughter
of
Elrond  B-PER
,
in
whom
it
was
said
that
the
likeness
of
Luthien B-PER
had
come
on
earth
again
;
and
she
was
called
Undomiel    B-PER
,
for
she
was
the
Evenstar
of
her
people
.
Out
flew
a
red
golden
dragon
not
life
size
,
but
terribly
life
like
:
fire
came
from
his
jaws
,
his
eyes
glared
down
;
there
was
a
roar
,
and
he
whizzed
three
times
over
the
heads
of
the
crowd
.
We
don't
often
see
Shire   B-LOC
folk
riding
on
the
Road
at
night
,
he
went
on
,
as
they
halted
a
moment
by
his
door
.
It
was
early
April
and
the
sky
was
now
clearing
after
heavy
rain
.
At
that
moment
the
rider
sat
up
,
and
shook
the
reins
.
In
what
far
time
and
place
did
he
come
into
the
world
,
and
when
would
he
leave
it
?
Here
the
Company
decided
to
stay
and
await
the
dawn
:
it
was
useless
to
attempt
to
move
further
by
night
.
For
a
while
out
of
politeness
the
hobbits
visited
the
Common
Room
in
the
evening
and
answered
a
good
many
questions
.
No
man
will
touch
them
I
promise
you
,
he
said
.
I
think
I
could
probably
make
some
arrangements
by
then
.
In
a
twinkling
the
table
was
laid
.
Smeagol B-PER
was
holding
a
debate
with
some
other
thought
that
used
the
same
voice
but
made
it
squeak
and
hiss
.
Leg
it
!
Well
,
here
is
the
strangest
riddle
that
we
have
yet
found
!
Must
bathe
feet
a
minute
.
That
was
a
regrettable
misunderstanding
,
long
set
right
.
It
is
but
a
trifle
that
Sauron  B-PER
fancies
,
and
an
earnest
of
your
good
will
.
Well
earned
?
Frodo   B-PER
sat
for
a
while
and
shivered
,
dreadful
fears
chasing
one
another
through
his
mind
.
No
,
said
Gandalf B-PER
.
So
wise
they
are
;
so
just
,
so
very
just
.
he
shouted
as
he
leaped
down
the
stair
from
the
Rock
with
many
men
of
Westfold    B-LOC
at
his
back
.
Pippin  B-PER
and
Sam B-PER
strapped
up
their
three
packs
and
piled
them
in
the
porch
.
No
,
not
at
the
rear
!
It
does
,
said
Frodo   B-PER
.
The
other
halted
,
and
his
voice
was
full
of
fear
and
rage
.
So
he
will
!
Darkness
came
early
to
the
silent
woods
,
and
before
the
fall
of
night
they
halted
,
weary
,
for
they
had
walked
seven
leagues
or
more
from
Henneth B-LOC
Annun   I-LOC
.
Some
suddenly
loomed
up
right
in
front
of
him
.
Before
long
,
washed
and
refreshed
,
the
hobbits
were
seated
at
the
table
,
two
on
each
side
,
while
at
either
end
sat
Gold    B-PER
berry   I-PER
and
the
Master
.
Come
,
Smeagol B-PER
!
He
is
a
valiant
man
.
Clang
.
They
came
swiftly
from
the
North
,
walking
like
wading
herons
in
their
gait
,
but
not
in
their
speed
;
for
their
legs
in
their
long
paces
beat
quicker
than
the
heron
s
wings
.
He
told
us
not
to
risk
getting
entangled
in
it
.
A
black
shadow
seemed
to
pass
like
an
arm
above
him
;
it
missed
Amon    B-LOC
Hen I-LOC
and
groped
out
west
,
and
faded
.
Why
did
it
come
to
me
?
I
think
one
of
his
spies
would
well
,
seem
fairer
and
feel
fouler
,
if
you
understand
.
In
days
to
come
,
if
my
Elven
lord
allows
,
some
of
our
folk
shall
remove
hither
;
and
when
we
come
it
shall
be
blessed
,
for
a
while
.
I
want
to
find
my
gaffer
.
’
So
do
I
,
’
said
Gandalf B-PER
.
Come
on
now
,
master
,
sing
us
something
that
we
haven’t
heard
before
!
Then
he
shut
and
locked
the
door
.
The
landlord
jumped
with
surprise
.
The
trail
led
them
north
along
the
top
of
the
escarpment
,
and
at
length
they
came
to
a
deep
cleft
carved
in
the
rock
by
a
stream
that
splashed
noisily
down
.
When
they
had
finished
they
stood
up
.
They
stared
at
him
in
alarm
for
a
moment
before
he
gasped
:
I
have
seen
them
,
Frodo   B-PER
!
It
is
not
a
very
broad
belt
I
should
have
said
no
more
than
a
mile
at
the
widest
and
we
ought
to
have
been
through
it
by
now
.
Frodo
went
in
once
,
long
ago
.
Behind
that
there
was
something
else
at
work
,
beyond
any
design
of
the
Ring
maker
.
You
are
not
alone
.
What
will
become
of
him
?
’
I
do
indeed
,
’
answered
Strider B-PER
.
’
Well
yes
and
no
.
I
thought
we
should
be
off
today
.
Be
wary
still
!
Ride
now
,
ride
!
My
heart
would
be
glad
if
I
were
beneath
the
eaves
of
that
wood
,
and
it
were
springtime
!
So
they
called
him
Gollum  B-PER
,
and
cursed
him
,
and
told
him
to
go
far
away
;
and
his
grandmother
,
desiring
peace
,
expelled
him
from
the
family
and
turned
him
out
of
her
hole
.
’
said
Frodo   B-PER
.
He
is
his
own
master
.
No
,
not
altogether
wicked
,
said
Frodo
.
It
would
possess
him
.
They
spoke
of
many
things
,
old
and
new
,
and
Frodo   B-PER
ques
tioned
Gildor  B-PER  
much
about
happenings
in
the
wide
world
outside
the
Shire   B-LOC
.
Now
the
time
was
anxious
,
and
the
host
was
in
peril
.
He
must
have
put
the
Ring
on
.
What
do
you
wish
?
Then
who
would
you
take
up
with
?
Will
you
come
and
see
it
?
That
came
in
his
tale
,
long
long
ago
.
And
why
do
men
fight
here
in
the
Hallows B-LOC
when
there
is
war
enough
before
the
Gate
?
The
Forest  B-LOC
of  I-LOC
Dr  I-LOC
adan
he
gives
to
Ghan    B-PER
buri    I-PER
ghan    I-PER
and
to
his
folk
,
to
be
their
own
for
ever
;
and
hereafter
let
no
man
enter
it
without
their
leave
!
Time
!
But
he
was
gone
.
Some
were
brightly
painted
,
and
shone
with
silver
and
gold
and
green
,
but
most
were
either
white
or
grey
.
He
was
interested
,
however
,
to
hear
that
Dain    B-PER
was
still
King
under
the
Mountain
,
and
was
now
old
(
having
passed
his
two
hundred
and
fiftieth
year
)
,
venerable
,
and
fabulously
rich
.
But
if
you
ask
me
,
Elrond  B-PER
will
send
out
a
fair
number
,
when
the
reports
come
in
.
I
do
not
foretell
,
for
all
foretelling
is
now
vain
:
on
the
one
hand
lies
darkness
,
and
on
the
other
only
hope
.
I
sit
beside
the
fire
and
think
of
people
long
ago
,
and
people
who
will
see
a
world
that
I
shall
never
know
.
’
But
just
as
he
thought
,
his
dinner
was
caught
,
He
found
his
hands
had
hold
of
naught
.
And
now
from
beyond
the
bridge
end
came
answering
cries
.
Come
and
look
and
tell
me
what
I
can
see
.
he
said
.
But
it
would
be
too
tiring
to
repeat
it
all
.
The
hobbits
seated
themselves
beside
him
,
one
on
either
side
.
The
great
doors
of
the
Black   B-LOC
Gate    I-LOC
swung
back
wide
.
And
he
collected
a
lot
,
I
can
tell
you
,
before
he
was
finally
caught
.
We
shall
all
be
scattered
and
lost
,
’
groaned
Aragorn B-PER
.
I
hope
,
if
I
do
go
to
sleep
in
this
bird
loft
,
that
I
shan’t
roll
off
,
’
he
said
.
They
allowed
themselves
half
a
piece
of
the
Elvish
waybread
each
.
There
is
no
sound
for
miles
about
us
,
and
your
voices
seem
to
make
the
ground
echo
.
One
can
meet
them
sometimes
in
the
Woody   B-LOC
End I-LOC
.
To
the
left
stood
a
great
mound
,
covered
with
a
sward
of
grass
as
green
as
Spring
time
in
the
Elder
Days
.
We
may
not
have
a
chance
of
filling
our
skins
and
bottles
till
we
come
down
into
Dimrill B-LOC
Dale    I-LOC
.
Indeed
I
may
now
reveal
that
it
was
partly
in
hope
to
find
that
ring
that
Balin   B-PER
went
away
.
They
spoke
little
as
they
trudged
along
.
Not
wholly
so
,
yet
it
did
not
achieve
its
end
.
Come
on
!
Strider B-PER
!
People
stared
much
as
he
passed
.
Come
,
Precious
is
waiting
!
I
was
told
to
find
you
before
Midsummer
,
and
that
is
now
here
.
Might
I
ask
your
names
,
sirs
?
I
guess
that
he
was
attacked
on
this
hill
top
,
but
with
what
result
I
cannot
tell
.
And
with
that
he
lifted
high
his
sword
and
flames
ran
down
the
blade
.
The
hobbits
wandered
here
and
there
visiting
again
the
places
that
they
had
passed
before
;
and
Sam B-PER
hoped
always
in
some
shadow
of
the
woods
or
secret
glade
to
catch
,
maybe
,
a
glimpse
of
the
great
Oliphaunt   
.
It
was
a
path
made
by
strong
arms
and
heavy
feet
.
No
,
I
can
t
give
no
message
.
Boats
may
make
your
journey
less
toilsome
for
a
while
.
Just
this
,
my
dear
old
Frodo   B-PER
:
you
are
miserable
,
because
you
don’t
know
how
to
say
good
bye
.
His
upturned
hornlike
tusks
were
bound
with
bands
of
gold
and
dripped
with
blood
.
The
travellers
passed
within
,
and
the
gates
shut
behind
them
.
Small
bands
of
weary
and
often
wounded
men
came
first
with
little
order
;
some
were
running
wildly
as
if
pursued
.
What
other
fairer
way
would
you
desire
?
chuckled
Merry   B-PER
as
he
rolled
himself
in
his
blanket
.
Time
is
pressing
,
said
the
Rider   B-PER
,
not
heeding
Aragorn B-PER
.
Yes
,
I
think
that
would
be
so
.
He
shuddered
and
said
no
more
,
leaving
Merry   B-PER
to
tell
of
those
last
horrible
moments
:
the
pawing
hands
,
the
hot
breath
,
and
the
dreadful
strength
of
Grishnakh's B-PER
hairy
arms
.
All
the
top
of
your
hill
is
full
of
tunnels
packed
with
chests
of
gold
and
silver
,
and
jools
,
by
what
I’ve
heard
.
And
yet
again
Ents
are
more
like
Men
,
more
changeable
than
Elves
are
,
and
quicker
at
taking
the
colour
of
the
outside
,
you
might
say
.
No
,
said
Merry   B-PER
.
As
the
dark
drew
on
I
knew
that
haste
was
needed
,
so
I
rode
thence
with
three
others
that
could
also
be
horsed
.
Even
the
Elves
do
likewise
at
need
,
and
blindfolded
we
crossed
the
borders
of
fair
Lothlorien  B-LOC
.
The
Riders
were
too
swift
to
overtake
,
and
too
many
to
oppose
.
I
fancy
now
that
she
could
do
some
wonderful
things
,
if
she
had
a
mind
.
It
has
passed
on
.
As
the
stars
above
the
mists
of
the
Northern
lands
was
her
loveliness
,
and
in
her
face
was
a
shining
light
.
They
rode
down
the
bank
and
looked
up
and
down
.
Dotard
!
Worst
is
a
bad
word
,
I
said
to
him
,
and
I
hope
you
do
not
live
to
see
it
.
The
Sackville   B-PER
Bagginses   I-PER
scowled
,
and
wondered
what
was
meant
by
coming
into
his
inheritance’
.
The
terrors
of
the
land
beyond
,
and
the
deed
to
be
done
there
,
seemed
remote
,
too
far
off
yet
to
trouble
him
.
Frodo   B-PER
was
the
wisest
person
in
the
world
(
with
the
possible
exception
of
Old
Mr.
Bilbo   B-PER
and
of
Gandalf B-PER
)
.
I
was
not
sent
to
beg
any
boon
,
but
to
seek
only
the
meaning
of
a
riddle
,
answered
Boromir B-PER
proudly
.
You
are
kindly
hosts
!
Leave
your
barrow
empty
!
The
Lord
drives
his
son
too
hard
,
and
now
he
must
do
the
duty
of
two
,
for
himself
and
for
the
one
that
will
not
return
.
The
late
afternoon
was
bright
and
peaceful
.
I
do
not
know
.
he
cried
.
I
never
really
expected
to
find
any
pipe
weed
on
the
journey
,
when
my
own
ran
out
.
Hullo
,
Sam B-PER
!
At
that
moment
some
dozen
Orcs
that
had
lain
motionless
among
the
slain
leaped
to
their
feet
,
and
came
silently
and
swiftly
behind
.
But
we
call
it
lembas
or
waybread
,
and
it
is
more
strengthening
than
any
food
made
by
Men
,
and
it
is
more
pleasant
than
cram
,
by
all
accounts
.
He
did
not
speak
so
that
I
could
hear
words
.
It
could
be
beaten
like
copper
,
and
polished
like
glass
;
and
the
Dwarves
could
make
of
it
a
metal
,
light
and
yet
harder
than
tempered
steel
.
That
night
they
camped
on
a
stony
shelf
with
a
rock
wall
behind
them
,
in
which
there
was
a
shallow
cave
,
a
mere
scoop
in
the
cliff
.
Black
drops
dripped
from
the
blade
and
smoked
on
the
floor
.
Maybe
thou
shalt
find
Valimar B-LOC
.
That
much
I
perceived
clearly
in
his
mind
.
They
did
not
talk
,
but
kept
glancing
back
,
and
from
side
to
side
.
’
We
can
cut
straighter
than
the
road
anyway
,
’
answered
Frodo   B-PER
.
You
ll
see
,
Mr.
Frodo   B-PER
.
Go
after
those
two
young
hobbits
,
and
guard
them
at
the
least
,
even
if
you
cannot
find
Frodo   B-PER
.
He
was
very
quiet
to
begin
with
,
but
his
fame
began
to
grow
.
Aye
,
you
do
indeed
,
said
Gimli   B-PER
,
looking
them
up
and
down
over
the
top
of
his
cup
.
It
is
no
good
trying
to
escape
you
.
Beneath
the
stars
of
Ever
eve
in
Eldamar B-LOC
it
shone
,
In
Eldamar B-LOC
beside
the
walls
of
Elven
Tirion  B-LOC
.
It
was
answered
;
and
to  
the
dismay
of
Frodo   B-PER
and
his
friends
out
from
the
trees
and
rocks
away
on
the
left
four
other
Riders  B-ORG
came
flying
.
Frodo   B-PER
came
in
soon
afterwards
,
and
found
him
sitting
in
the
dark
,
deep
in
thought
.
Away
in
the
distance
eastward
they
could
now
see
a
line
of
hills
.
Same
one
,
I
reckon
.
There's
a
tidy
bit
of
money
tucked
away
up
there
,
I
hear
tell
,
said
a
stranger
,
a
visitor
on
business
from
Michel  B-LOC
Delving I-LOC
in
the
Westfarthing    B-LOC
