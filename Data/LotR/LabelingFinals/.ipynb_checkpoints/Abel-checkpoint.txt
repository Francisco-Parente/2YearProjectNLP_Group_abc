But
I
suppose
you
must
take
it
back
.
There
was
no
undergrowth
.
He
climbed
in
those
trees
,
and
he
couldn
t
wash
the
smell
off
his
hands
,
my
nice
hands
.
Day
was
coming
again
in
the
world
outside
,
and
far
beyond
the
glooms
of
Mordor	B-LOC
the
Sun
was
climbing
over
the
eastern
rim
of
Middle	B-LOC	
earth	I-LOC
;
but
here
all
was
still
dark
as
night
.
Now
be
quiet
!
Upon
the
east
too
sheer
and
stony
was
the
valley
s
side
;
upon
the
left
,
from
the
west
,
their
final
doom
approached
.
I
can’t
get
it
now
.
’
He
opened
the
door
,
and
they
followed
him
down
a
short
passage
and
round
a
sharp
turn
.
That
night
they
set
a
watch
,
and
Strider	B-PER
,
it
seemed
,
did
not
sleep
at
all
.
The
others
no
doubt
will
make
shift
to
tread
the
path
behind
us
.
Taking
in
folk
off
hand
like
and
eating
extra
food
,
and
all
that
,
said
Hob	B-PER
.
Yet
I
had
caught
no
hint
of
anything
wrong
in
his
voice
or
in
his
eye
at
our
meeting
.
Night
comes
.
’
The
eighth
is
a
dwarf
,
’
said
Legolas	B-PER
.
But
so
far
my
only
thought
has
been
to
get
here
;
and
I
hope
I
shan’t
have
to
go
any
further
.
Does
he
think
that
men
sleep
without
watch
all
night
?
No
,
he
is
gone
,
said
Eowyn	B-PER
turning
away
and
looking
at
the
mountains
dark
against
the
East
and
South
.
Clear
are
thy
eyes
and
bright
thy
breath
!
And
after
what
has
happened
tonight
another
will
come
,
I
think
,
and
swiftly
.
He
was
no
longer
holding
the
Ring
,
but
it
was
there
,
a
hidden
power
,
a
cowing
menace
to
the
slaves
of
Mordor B-LOC
;
and
in
his
hand
was
Sting
,
and
its
light
smote
the
eyes
of
the
orc
like
the
glitter
of
cruel
stars
in
the
terrible
elf
countries
,
the
dream
of
which
was
a
cold
fear
to
all
his
kind
.
Forgive
me
,
but
that
too
must
be
left
at
the
doors
.
said
Merry B-PER
.
And
now
Faramir	B-PER
was
gone
again
.
Otherwise
he
obviously
thought
the
whole
thing
rather
above
my
head
,
and
he
said
that
if
I
had
the
cheek
to
make
verses
about
Earendil	B-PER
in
the
house
of
Elrond	B-PER
,
it
was
my
affair
.
He
has
no
strength
to
match
you
.
said
Gandalf	B-PER
,
and
for
a
moment
it
seemed
that
a
cloud
of
pain
passed
over
his
face
,
and
he
sat
silent
,
looking
old
as
death
.
The
doors
rolled
back
and
a
keen
air
came
whistling
in
.
It
shall
be
,
lord
,
as
you
command
.
letting
his
master
s
legs
dangle
.
If
you
say
that
again
,
I
shall
.
He
stands
a
fair
chance
of
being
spitted
for
an
Orc
,
or
of
being
roasted
by
the	
Yellow	B-PER
Face	I-PER
.
I
reached
here
at
last
by
a
long
hard
road
,
up
the
Hoarwell	B-LOC
and
through
the
Ettenmoors B-LOC
,
and
down
from
the
north
.
O
Lady
clear
!
They
felt
their
way
along
the
water’s
edge
for
some
distance
,
until
they
found
a
small
shallow
bay
.
Very
good
!
They
will
come
soon
and
speak
to
me
here
.
There
are
no
Bagginses	B-PER
here
.
Sam	B-PER
had
changed
before
his
very
eyes
into
an
orc
again
,
leering
and
pawing
at
his
treasure
,
a
foul
little
creature
with
greedy
eyes
and
slobbering
mouth
.
You
seem
to
know
a
lot
,
said
Uglok	B-PER
.
Mr.
The	B-PER
Chief	I-PER
s
up
at
Bag	B-LOC
End	I-LOC
.
And
I
warn
you
that
peril
is
now
both
before
you
and
behind
you
,
and
upon
either
side
.
And
hold
to
your
purpose
!
’
We
will
not
start
until
it
is
fully
dark
,
’
said
Aragorn	B-PER
.
It
did
look
like
home
.
What
have
you
to
say
now
,
Frodo	B-PER
?
He
was
on
a
dark
heath
,
and
there
was
a
strange
salt
smell
in
the
air
.
And
all
the
lands
that
you
see
,
and
those
that
lie
round
about
them
,
shall
be
dwellings
of
Men
.
They
always
wished
to
talk
to
everything
,
the
old
Elves
did
.
He
returned
to
the
bank
,
close
to
where
the
rill
from
the
spring
trickled
out
into
the
River
.
They
felt
that
he
would
know
how
to
deal
with
Black	B-ORG
Riders	I-ORG
,
if
anyone
did
.
If
once
he
could
do
that
impossible
thing
,
then
somehow
the
errand
would
be
accomplished
,
or
so
it
seemed
to
him
in
that
dark
hour
of
weariness
,
still
labouring
in
the
stony
shadows
under
Cirith	B-LOC
Ungol	I-LOC
.
Curtains
of
wind
blown
rain
were
slanting
down
.
The
three
Riders
that
were
still
in
the
midst
of
the
Ford
were
overwhelmed
:
they
disappeared
,
buried
suddenly
under
angry
foam
.
I
wish
that
there
were
leisure
now
to
walk
among
them
:
they
have
voices
,
and
in
time
I
might
come
to
understand
their
thought
.
The
Orcs
must
have
been
aware
from
this
point
that
they
were
pursued
;
they
may
have
made
some
attempt
to
get
their
captives
away
before
they
were
overtaken
.
I
do
not
know
,
but
it
seems
clear
to
me
that
this
is
what
happened
.
Hoom
!
Why
,
it
might
have
been
put
there
a
purpose
!
But
,
of
course
,
I
have
my
price
.
They
will
return
.
Nay
,
not
yet
,
Master
Peregrin	B-PER
!
Then
with
a
rush
it
leaped
across
the
fissure
.
But
in
my
stead
you
shall
go
,
Ring
bearer
,
when
the
time
comes
,
and
if
you
then
desire
it
.
The
Lord
Saruman	B-PER
is
within
;
but
at
the
moment
he
is
closeted
with
one
Wormtongue	B-PER
,
or
doubtless
he
would
be
here
to
welcome
such
honourable
guests
.
Clear
voices
rose
and
fell
in
the
starlit
air
.
It
is
one
thing
to
take
my
young
friends
walking
over
the
Shire	B-LOC
with
me
,
until
we
are
hungry
and
weary
,
and
food
and
bed
are
sweet
.
Yes
,
it
is
all
very
dim
,
and
stuffy
,
in
here
,
said
Pippin	B-PER
.
The
woods
in
the
valley
were
still
leafy
and
full
of
colour
,
and
seemed
peaceful
and
wholesome
.
You
have
had
your
joke
,
and
alarmed
or
offended
most
of
your
relations
,
and
given
the
whole
Shire	B-LOC
something
to
talk
about
for
nine
days
,
or
ninety
nine
more
likely
.
He
thinks
less
than
he
talks
,
and
slower
;
yet
he
can
see
through
a
brick
wall
in
time
(
as
they
say
in
Bree	B-LOC
)
.
We
shall
be
making
an
early
start
.
After
that
journey
,
and
the
road
I
have
trodden
with
this
Company
,
I
do
not
much
doubt
that
I
shall
find
a
way
through
Rohan	B-LOC
,
and
Fangorn	B-LOC
too
,
if
need
be
.
The
narrow
path
now
wound
under
a
sheer
wall
of
cliffs
to
the
left
,
above
which
the
grim
flanks
of
Caradhras	B-LOC
towered
up
invisible
in
the
gloom
;
on
the
right
was
a
gulf
of
darkness
where
the
land
fell
suddenly
into
a
deep
ravine
.
Then
suddenly
,
unable
to
contain
himself
longer
,
he
burst
out
:
Your
bow
,
Legolas	B-PER
!
A
faint
light
grew
in
the
hall
again
.
The
wind
blows
from
the
East
there
,
for
they
look
out
over
the
Dead	B-LOC
Marshes	I-LOC
and
the
Noman	B-LOC
lands	I-LOC
to
Cirith	B-LOC
Gorgor	I-LOC
and
the
black
gates
of
Mordor	B-LOC
.
The
beacons
of
Gondor	B-LOC
are
alight
,
calling
for
aid
.
And
in
that
case
so
is
the
Redhorn	B-LOC
Gate	I-LOC
,
said
Gandalf	B-PER
;
and
how
we
can
get
over
that
without
being
seen
,
I
cannot
imagine
.
Which
shore
will
you
now
take
?
’
Together
they
carried
out
Merry	B-PER
,
Pippin	B-PER
,
and
Sam	B-PER
.
Tom	B-PER
s
words
laid
bare
the
hearts
of
trees
and
their
thoughts
,
which
were
often
dark
and
strange
,
and
filled
with
a
hatred
of
things
that
go
free
upon
the
earth
,
gnawing
,
biting
,
breaking
,
hacking
,
burning
:
destroyers
and
usurpers
.
His
trappings
of
scarlet
and
gold
flapped
about
him
in
wild
tatters
.
And
in
his
arms
before
him
on
his
horse
he
bore
the
body
of
his
kinsman
,
Faramir	B-PER
son
of
Denethor	B-PER
,
found
upon
the
stricken
field
.
As
well
as
we
could
guess
,
there
are
few
left
upon
the
out
wall
,
and
they
are
heedless
,
busy
in
destruction
.
There
was
a
ring
of
metal
.
You
are
always
badgering
me
about
my
ring
;
but
you
have
never
bothered
me
about
the
other
things
that
I
got
on
my
journey
.
Stay
!
Her
long
yellow
hair
rippled
down
her
shoulders
;
her
gown
was
green
,
green
as
young
reeds
,
shot
with
silver
like
beads
of
dew
;
and
her
belt
was
of
gold
,
shaped
like
a
chain
of
flag
lilies
set
with
the
pale
blue
eyes
of
forget
me
nots
.
Merry	B-PER
alone
seemed
fairly
cheerful
.
He
leaped
into
the
waters
,
but
the
Ring
slipped
from
his
finger
as
he
swam
,
and
then
the
Orcs
saw
him
and
killed
him
with
arrows
.
That
s
hard
,
cruel
hard
.
When
winter
passed
,
she
came
again
,
And
her
song
released
the
sudden
spring
,
Like
rising
lark
,
and
falling
rain
,
And
melting
water
bubbling
.
If
that’s
where
you
get
your
news
from
,
you’ll
never
want
for
moonshine
.
After
that
I
shall
have
another
sleep
,
I
think
;
but
I
shan
t
be
able
to
close
my
eyes
until
you
have
finished
the
story
for
me
.
If
we
keep
on
as
we
are
going
we
shall
get
up
into
the
Ettendales	B-LOC
far
north
of
RivendellA	B-LOC
.
Now
,
Sam	B-PER
Gamgee	I-PER
,
this
is
the
end
of
ends
.
Then
by
some
shift
of
airs
all
the
mist
was
drawn
away
like
a
veil
,
and
there
leaned
up
,
as
he
climbed
over
the
rim
of
the
world
,
the
Swordsman
of
the
Sky
,
Menelvagor	B-PER
with
his
shining
belt
.
If
this
nice
friendliness
would
spread
about
in
Mordor	B-LOC
,
half
our
trouble
would
be
over
.
O
!
All
at
once
,
as
if
through
a
gate
of
light
,
the
Road
ran
out
again
from
the
end
of
the
tunnel
into
the
open
.
It
was
hard
to
say
of
what
colour
they
were
:
grey
with
the
hue
of
twilight
under
the
trees
they
seemed
to
be
;
and
yet
if
they
were
moved
,
or
set
in
another
light
,
they
were
green
as
shadowed
leaves
,
or
brown
as
fallow
fields
by
night
,
dusk
silver
as
water
under
the
stars
.
With
that
he
stood
up
and
went
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
gully
again
.
said
Sam	B-PER
.
We
sing
to
thee
In
a
far
land
beyond
the
Sea
.
On
the
land
of
Lorien	B-LOC
there
was
no
stain
.
said
Frodo	B-PER
,
pushing
back
his
chair
.
Each
time
they
climbed
a
ridge
the
breeze
seemed
to
have
grown
less
.
They
ll
wake
too
quick
and
kill
us
,
whined
Smeagol	B-PER
in
a
last
effort
.
he
shouted
wildly
,
like
an
onlooker
at
a
great
race
urging
on
a
runner
who
is
far
beyond
encouragement
.
What
about
?
Come
and
go
as
you
like
,
as
long
as
you
don
t
make
a
noise
.
he
said
.
Faramir	B-PER
took
a
small
nail
knife
from
his
belt
and
handed
it
to
Frodo B-PER
.
Speak
plainer
!
He
will
,
said
Gandalf B-PER
.
That
is
what
he
most
fears
,
I
deem
.
The
grandson
of
Bard	B-PER
the	I-PER
Bowman	I-PER
rules
them
,
Brand	B-PER
son
of
Bain	B-PER
son
of
Bard	B-PER
.
For
though
I
do
not
ask
for
aid
,
we
need
it
.
You
agreed
to
that
,
you
remember
.
He
had
not
come
,
nor
any
of
your
Company	B-ORG
,
when
I
set
out
six
days
ago
.
Ride
on
!
The
orcs
hindered
by
the
mires
that
lay
before
the
hills
halted
and
poured
their
arrows
into
the
defending
ranks
.
Do
you
bring
men
?
Well
,
my
lord
Steward	B-PER
,
it
is
your
task
to
keep
some
kingdom
still
against
that
event
,
which
few
now
look
to
see
.
I
can
still
remember
ten
score
of
them
without
searching
in
my
mind
.
Some
way
ahead
,
a
mile
or
so
,
perhaps
,
was
a
great
grey
wall
,
a
last
huge
upthrusting
mass
of
mountain
stone
.
What
of
the
tale
?
said
Bilbo	B-PER
.
But
I
am
not
in
a
hurry
tonight
.
It
was
then
that
they
dis
covered
that
Boromir	B-PER
,
who
at
first
had
been
sitting
silent
on
the
outside
of
the
circle
,
was
no
longer
there
.
The
forest
where
Faramir	B-PER
had
stood
seemed
empty
and
drear
,
as
if
a
dream
had
passed
.
I
thought
he
was
only
a
Ranger	B-PER
.
First
check
!
In
the
morning
they
went
on
again
,
walking
without
haste
.
Ever
my
heart
rises
as
we
draw
near
the
mountains
.
What
was
the
thing
,
or
were
there
many
of
them
?
I
know
.
He
took
his
master
s
hand
and
bent
over
it
.
I
will
lead
you
now
!
That
has
not
happened
in
this
Forest
since
the
wars
of
Sauron	B-PER
and
the
Men	B-ORG
of	I-ORG
the	I-ORG
Sea	I-ORG
.
But
you
speak
of
him
as
if
he
was
a
friend
.
But
I
do
not
desire
healing
,
she
said
.
We
do
not
want
the
escapes
of
Mirkwood	B-LOC
in
Ithilien	B-LOC
.
I
will
follow
your
lead
now
if
this
last
warning
does
not
move
you
.
Long
she
had
been
in
the
land
of
her
mother’s
kin
,
in
Lorien	B-LOC
beyond
the
mountains
,
and
was
but
lately
returned
to
Rivendell	B-LOC
to
her
father’s
house
.
And
then
we
can
have
some
rest
and
some
sleep
,
said
Sam	B-PER
.
He
remained
on
visiting
terms
with
his
relatives
(
except
,
of
course
,
the
Sackville	B-PER
Bagginses	I-PER
)
,
and
he
had
many
devoted
admirers
among
the
hobbits
of
poor
and
unimportant
families
.
I
regret
to
announce
that
though
,
as
I
said
,
eleventy
one
years
is
far
too
short
a
time
to
spend
among
you
this
is
the
END
.
He
stood
up
and
cast
open
his
long
black
cloak
,
and
behold
!
But
defenders
and
foes
alike
gave
up
the
battle
and
fled
when
we
came
,
crying
out
that
the
King	B-PER
of	I-PER
the	I-PER
Dead	I-PER
was
upon
them
.
So
much
I
have
heard
but
no
more
.
It
has
been
treasured
by
his
heirs
when
all
other
heirlooms
were
lost
;
for
it
was
spoken
of
old
among
us
that
it
should
be
made
again
when
the
Ring
,
Isildur	B-PER
s
Bane
,
was
found
.
The
wind
had
been
turning
through
north
to
north
west
during
the
night
,
and
now
it
failed
.
He
laughed
again
,
seeing
the
dismay
in
Pippin	B-PER
s
face
.
Regiments
of
black
crows
are
flying
over
all
the
land
between
the
Mountains
and
the
Greyflood	B-LOC
,
he
said
,
and
they
have
passed
over
Hollin	B-LOC
.
I
wonder
where
Isengard	B-LOC
is
?
If
I
understand
aright
all
that
I
have
heard
,
’
he
said
,
I
think
that
this
task
is
appointed
for
you
,
Frodo	B-PER
;
and
that
if
you
do
not
find
a
way
,
no
one
will
.
Maybe
he
was
called
,
said
Theoden	B-PER
;
and
my
heart
tells
me
that
I
shall
not
see
him
again
.
On
down
the
grey
road
they
went
beside
the
Snowbourn	B-LOC
rushing
on
its
stones
;
through
the
hamlets
of
Underharrow	B-LOC
and
Upbourn	B-LOC
,
where
many
sad
faces
of
women
looked
out
from
dark
doors
;
and
so
without
horn
or
harp
or
music
of
men
s
voices
the
great
ride
into
the
East
began
with
which
the
songs
of
Rohan	B-LOC
were
busy
for
many
long
lives
of
men
thereafter
.
he
cried
.
At
last
they
reached
the
crest
of
the
grey
hill
,
and
a
sudden
breeze
blew
in
their
hair
and
stirred
their
cloaks
:
the
chill
wind
of
dawn
.
They
were
the
hobbits
chief
source
of
news
from
distant
parts
if
they
wanted
any
:
as
a
rule
dwarves
said
little
and
hobbits
asked
no
more
.
Some
,
doubtless
,
were
no
better
than
tramps
,
ready
to
dig
a
hole
in
any
bank
and
stay
only
as
long
as
it
suited
them
.
Sam	B-PER
took
his
master
s
hands
and
laid
them
together
,
palm
to
palm
,
and
kissed
them
;
and
then
he
held
them
gently
between
his
own
.
Go
now
?
Many
words
and
few
to
the
point
.
I
d
carry
you
on
my
back
,
if
I
could
.
Sam	B-PER
quickly
blushed
and
hung
his
head
.
They
seem
to
have
made
a
last
stand
by
both
doors
,
he
said
;
but
there
were
not
many
left
by
that
time
.
We
are
Exiles
,
and
most
of
our
kindred
have
long
ago
departed
and
we
too
are
now
only
tarrying
here
a
while
,
ere
we
return
over
the
Great	B-LOC
Sea	I-LOC
.
’
Ah
!
Frodo	B-PER
was
chilled
to
the
marrow
.
even
the
Moon
is
falling
into
gathering
cloud
.
Is
Rivendell	B-LOC
safe
?
Inside
it
was
damp
and
cheerless
,
and
supper
was
served
on
a
long
bare
table
that
had
not
been
scrubbed
for
weeks
.
Indeed
you
look
in
the
bloom
of
health
.
I
do
not
know
if
I
can
do
anything
to
help
you
;
but
I
will
whisper
this
in
your
ears
.
Sit
up
!
I
forgive
you
.
Bill	B-PER
,
seeming
to
understand
well
what
was
going
on
,
nuzzled
up
to
him
,
putting
his
nose
to
Sam’s	B-PER
ear
.
If
they
held
to
their
pace
,
then
at
sundown
yesterday
they
would
reach
the
borders
of
Fangorn	B-LOC
.
Take
it
off
!
I
am
so
torn
between
rage
and
joy
,
that
if
I
do
not
burst
.
White
cloth
may
be
dyed
.
He
bent
over
her
like
a
cloud
,
and
his
eyes
glittered
;
he
raised
his
mace
to
kill
.
The
cold
stone
is
fallen
;
Dark
door
is
standing
wide
;
dead
hand
is
broken
.
But
let
us
not
tarry
here
.
she
said
bitterly
.
Suddenly
he
stopped
and
waved
his
arms
.
But
we
have
got
to
try
and
get
there
;
and
it
won’t
be
done
by
sitting
and
thinking
.
Hence
the
excitement
of
the
hobbit
children
.
Sometimes
in
the
silence
of
that
barren
country
they
fancied
that
they
heard
faint
sounds
behind
them
,
a
stone
falling
,
or
the
imagined
step
of
flapping
feet
on
the
rock
.
Over
we
go
!
He
walked
briskly
back
to
his
hole
,
and
stood
for
a
moment
listening
with
a
smile
to
the
din
in
the
pavilion
and
to
the
sounds
of
merrymaking
in
other
parts
of
the
field
.
It’s
not
his
now
,
but
mine
.
said
Sam	B-PER
pointing
to
the
left
.
Quite
simple
.
Then
Boromir	B-PER
had
come
leaping
through
the
trees
.
Well
,
now
we
must
halt
again
and
wear
the
night
away
.
Travellers
shiver
when
they
see
it
,
they
creep
out
of
sight
,
they
avoid
its
shadow
.
They
rode
across
and
looked
northwards
.
You
make
that
clearer
with
every
word
you
say
.
He
dared
not
open
his
eyes
or
look
up
.
Good
luck
,
Sam	B-PER
!
It
is
well
that
I
did
so
,
for
now
we
have
several
miles
less
to
cross
,
and
haste
is
needed
.
’
He
ran
to
the
ponies
and
before
long
came
back
with
two
tinder
boxes
and
a
hatchet
.
But
anyway
you
do
not
seem
to
fit
in
anywhere
!
He
felt
desperate
:
lost
and
witless
.
They
went
forward
steadily
,
but
they
soon
saw
that
the
Road
was
further
away
than
they
had
imagined
.
I
was
mortally
afraid
,
of
course
;
but
if
I
had
known
more
,
I
should
not
have
dared
even
to
move
.
He
shivered
.
What
are
they
doing
?
she
cried
to
those
about
her
.
I
saw
nothing
,
but
I
didn’t
stop
to
look
.
While
they
were
still
able
to
give
heed
to
such
things
,
they
could
hear
his
breath
hissing
and
gasping
just
in
front
of
them
.
As
far
as
their
eyes
could
reach
,
along
the
skirts
of
the
Morgai	B-LOC
and
away
southward
,
there
were
camps
,
some
of
tents
,
some
ordered
like
small
towns
.
Here
s
my
pretty
lady
!
The
isle
has
fallen
.
Already
in
this
southern
land
they
were
blushing
red
at
their
fingertips
.
The
stroke
on
the
left
might
be
a
G
rune
with
thin
branches
,
’
said
Strider	B-PER
.
We
must
be
getting
off
at
once
.
Some
of
us
are
still
true
Ents
,
and
lively
enough
in
our
fashion
,
but
many
are
growing
sleepy
,
going
tree
ish
,
as
you
might
say
.
Certainly
,
said
Gandalf	B-PER
.
There
was
a
cold
gleam
in
it
.
He
was
a
funny
customer
and
asking
funny
questions
.
But
you
need
ask
no
questions
.
It
is
clad
in
a
forest
of
dark
fir
,
where
the
trees
strive
one
against
another
and
their
branches
rot
and
wither
.
Good
night
!
Again
Gandalf	B-PER
approached
the
wall
,
and
lifting
up
his
arms
he
spoke
in
tones
of
command
and
rising
wrath
.
And
what
was
said
therein
was
already
known
.
But
what
did
I
say
?
Then
they
wrapped
themselves
warmly
,
not
only
in
the
fur
cloaks
of
the
Elves
,
but
in
their
own
blankets
as
well
,
and
tried
to
go
to
sleep
.
It
would
take
more
than
such
an
orc
scratch
to
keep
me
back
.
At
the
feet
of
the
trees
,
and
all
about
the
green
hillsides
the
grass
was
studded
with
small
golden
flowers
shaped
like
stars
.
One
of
you
might
have
fallen
in
and
still
be
wondering
when
you
were
going
to
strike
the
bottom
,
’
said
Aragorn	B-PER
to
Merry	B-PER
.
There
are
some
things
that
it
is
better
to
begin
than
to
refuse
,
even
though
the
end
may
be
dark
.
Then
if
you
will
have
it
so
,
lady
,
he
said
:
you
do
not
go
,
because
only
your
brother
called
for
you
,
and
to
look
on
the
Lord
Aragorn	B-PER
,
Elendil	B-PER
s
heir
,
in
his
triumph
would
now
bring
you
no
joy
.
But
in
this
I
judge
that
you
speak
the
truth
.
I
will
not
speak
of
that
journey
.
Sleepily
he
tried
to
reckon
the
times
and
stages
of
their
journey
,
but
his
memory
was
drowsy
and
uncertain
.
Such
words
and
ifs
are
vain
.
Sam	B-PER
scowled
at
him
,
and
sucked
his
teeth
;
but
he
seemed
to
sense
that
there
was
something
odd
about
his
master
s
mood
and
that
the
matter
was
beyond
argument
.
He
drew
a
deep
breath
.
He
had
a
blue
coat
and
a
long
brown
beard
;
his
eyes
were
blue
and
bright
,
and
his
face
was
red
as
a
ripe
apple
,
but
creased
into
a
hundred
wrinkles
of
laughter
.
Maggots
!
And
the
Eagles
of
the
Mountains
went
far
and
wide
,
and
they
saw
many
things
:
the
gathering
of
wolves
and
the
mustering
of
Ores
;
and
the
Nine	B-PER
Riders	I-PER
going
hither
and
thither
in
the
lands
;
and
they
heard
news
of
the
escape
of
Gollum	B-PER
.
Pippin	B-PER
fell
asleep
,
pillowed
on
a
green
hillock
.
In
panoply
of
ancient
kings
,
in
chain
d
rings
he
armoured
him
;
his
shining
shield
was
scored
with
runes
to
ward
all
wounds
and
harm
from
him
;
his
bow
was
made
of
dragon
horn
,
his
arrows
shorn
of
ebony
,
of
silver
was
his
habergeon
,
his
scabbard
of
chalcedony
;
his
sword
of
steel
was
valiant
,
of
adamant
his
helmet
tall
,
an
eagle
plume
upon
his
crest
,
upon
his
breast
an
emerald
.
But
this
creature
is
in
some
way
bound
up
with
my
errand
.
Then
maybe
you
can
see
it
in
your
mind
s
eye
:
a
great
horn
of
the
wild
ox
of
the
East
,
bound
with
silver
,
and
written
with
ancient
characters
.
And
as
he
waited
,
he
felt
,
more
urgent
than
ever
before
,
the
command
that
he
should
put
on
the
Ring
.
This
is
the
storehouse
and
buttery
of
my
company
of
the
Guard	B-ORG
.
Gandalf	B-PER
passed
now
into
the
wide
land
beyond
the
Rammas	B-LOC
Echor	I-LOC
.
and
ever
they
heard
that
soft
voice
whispering
and
urging
them
.
I
am
getting
very
suspicious
of
this
ForesT
and
everything
in
it
,
and
I
begin
to
believe
all
the
stories
about
it
.
As
if
stricken
by
some
blasting
spell
it
burst
asunder
:
there
was
a
flash
of
searing
lightning
,
and
the
doors
tumbled
in
riven
fragments
to
the
ground
.
They
fool
about
with
boats
on
that
big
river
and
that
isn
t
natural
.
This
is
not
orc
stuff
,
but
man
food
,
as
Treebeard	B-PER
calls
it
.
That
you
need
not
pursue
them
further
,
said
Eomer 	B-PER
.
Frodo	B-PER
gasped
.
So
do
I
,
said
Sam	B-PER
.
’
To
which
the
other
half
of
his
mind
always
replied
:
Not
yet
.
The
gate
opened
and
three
huge
dogs
came
pelting
out
into
the
lane
,
and
dashed
towards
the
travellers
,
barking
fiercely
.
Where
is
this
prisoner
?
In
some
other
time
and
place
Pippin	B-PER
might
have
been
pleased
with
his
new
array
,
but
he
knew
now
that
he
was
taking
part
in
no
play
;
he
was
in
deadly
earnest
the
servant
of
a
grim
master
in
the
greatest
peril
.
In
the
darkness
it
was
hard
to
be
sure
that
they
were
indeed
moving
at
all
;
but
slowly
the
swirl
of
the
water
grew
less
,
and
the
shadow
of
the
eastern
bank
faded
back
into
the
night
.
I
hoped
that
Frodo	B-PER
had
set
forth
at
once
,
as
my
letter
had
urged
,
and
that
he
had
reached
Rivendell	B-LOC
before
the
deadly
pursuit
began
.
Indeed
I
alone
can
aid
you
now
.
Give
it
to
me
!
And
as
he
did
so
a
great
fear
fell
on
all
,
defender
and
foe
alike
;
and
the
hands
of
men
drooped
to
their
sides
,
and
no
bow
sang
.
Wait
a
few
minutes
for
me
at
the
bottom
,
but
if
I
do
not
come
soon
,
go
on
!
I
said
.
But
I
was
not
here
then
.
Even
the
leaves
were
silent
,
and
the
very
falls
seemed
to
be
hushed
.
said
Merry	B-PER
and
Pippin	B-PER
together
,
and
they
turned
away
hastily
.
We
ve
escaped
from
the
Emyn	B-LOC
Muil	I-LOC
!
Whatever
they
have
to
eat
and
drink
,
we
can
t
get
it
.
They
came
a
few
timid
steps
further
into
the
room
,
and
began
to
bow
low
,
feeling
strangely
surprised
and
awkward
,
like
folk
that
,
knocking
at
a
cottage
door
to
beg
for
a
drink
of
water
,
have
been
answered
by
a
fair
young
elf
queen
clad
in
living
flowers
.
Through
Lorien	B-LOC
we
came
of
which
it
were
well
that
you
should
learn
the
truth
ere
you
speak
of
it
again
and
thence
down
the
leagues
of
the
Great
River
to
the
falls
of
Rauros	B-LOC
.
No
word
did
he
ever
speak
of
it
to
any
of
the
Council	B-ORG
.
Frodo	B-PER
was
sitting
at
a
table
with
a
lot
of
papers
in
front
of
him
.
Worm
!
Believe
what
you
will
,
there
is
no
other
way
for
us
unless
you
would
go
back
to
Moria	B-LOC
gate
,
or
scale
the
pathless
mountains
,
or
swim
the
Great
River
all
alone
.
Sam	B-PER
smiled
grimly
at
this
description
of
himself
.
cried
Boromir	B-PER
and
leaped
after
him
.
And
soon
the
word
had
gone
out
from
the
House
that
the
king
was
indeed
come
among
them
,
and
after
war
he
brought
healing
;
and
the
news
ran
through
the
City
.
Overhead
there
hung
a
heavy
roof
,
sombre
and
featureless
,
and
light
seemed
rather
to
be
failing
than
growing
.
Worse
,
there
was
a
whole
line
of
the
ugly
new
houses
all
along
Pool
Side
,
where
the
Hobbiton	B-LOC
Road	I-LOC
ran
close
to
the
bank
.
And
long
listening’s
hungry
work
,
morning
,
noon
,
and
evening
!
To
the
amazement
of
the
others
,
Saruman	B-PER
turned
again
.
The
Lady
Eowyn	B-PER
is
she
,
sister
of
Eomer	B-PER
;
and
we
knew
naught
of
her
riding
until
this
hour
,
and
greatly
we
rue
it
.
Others
were
still
coming
in
by
twos
and
threes
through
a
dark
narrow
door
on
one
side
.
Beside
the
way
in
a
stone
channel
a
stream
of
clear
water
flowed
,
sparkling
and
chattering
.
By
night
they
had
reached
the
feet
of
the
westward
slopes
,
and
there
they
camped
.
For
in
the
days
of
Isildur	B-PER
the
Ruling
Ring
passed
out
of
all
knowledge
,
and
the
Three
were
released
from
its
dominion
.
And
then
Faramir	B-PER
cried
:
Behold
the
King
!
Five
and
forty
leagues
as
the
crow
flies
we
have
come
,
though
many
long
miles
further
our
feet
have
walked
.
He
sprang
forward
to
Boromir’s	B-PER
side
and
drew
himself
up
to
his
full
height
.
I
hope
it
won’t
come
to
that
!
The
growing
light
revealed
to
them
a
land
already
,
less
barren
and
ruinous
.
I
do
not
know
the
reason
for
your
flight
,
and
therefore
I
do
not
know
by
what
means
your
pursuers
will
assail
you
.
’
Where
did
you
learn
such
tales
,
if
all
the
land
is
empty
and
forgetful
?
They
seem
to
like
them
as
much
as
food
,
or
more
.
Yes
,
we
certainly
must
decide
what
to
do
at
once
,
answered
Strider	B-PER
,
looking
up
and
considering
the
time
and
the
weather
.
At
last
they
came
suddenly
into
a
thin
shade
;
great
grey
branches
reached
across
the
path
.
At
that
moment
Boromir	B-PER
reappeared
.
This
is
what
I
have
really
been
longing
for
,
for
years
!
It
fell
upon
his
ears
like
the
echo
of
all
the
joys
he
had
ever
known
.
At
first
it
seemed
to
the
hobbits
that
although
they
walked
and
stumbled
until
they
were
weary
,
they
were
creeping
forward
like
snails
,
and
getting
nowhere
.
I
would
give
them
Bag	B-LOC
End	I-LOC
and
everything
else
,
if
I
could
get
Bilbo	B-PER
back
and
go
off
tramping
in
the
country
with
him
.
Between
them
they
turned
the
whole
place
upside
down
.
How
long
will
the
day
tarry
?
Yes
,
alas
!
I
had
a
funny
dream
an
hour
or
two
before
we
stopped
,
Mr.
They
hate
us
far
more
,
altogether
and
all
the
time
.
But
then
he
turned
aside
.
But
say
on
!
He
came
,
a
weary
man
with
dinted
helm
and
cloven
shield
.
Or
if
you
desire
it
,
we
will
come
to
Rohan	B-LOC
and
bring
him
back
to
rest
with
his
own
people
.
The
wind
s
changing
,
said
Merry	B-PER
.
More
deadly
to
him
was
the
name
of
Elbereth	B-PER
.
They
had
not
gone
far
when
Frodo	B-PER
paused
.
’
Eight
,
’
said
Legolas	B-PER
.
As
they
came
to
the
gates
Cirdan	B-PER
the	I-PER
Shipwright	I-PER
came
forth
to
greet
them
.
He
shuddered
.
To
him
,
I
mean
,
begging
your
pardon
,
Master
Boromir	B-PER
,
’
he
added
,
and
turned
.
I
don
t
know
.
I
was
only
fifty
one
then
,
and
birthdays
did
not
seem
so
important
.
But
you
must
admit
that
it
was
very
intriguing
,
and
I
was
only
in
my
teens
.
It
was
cool
,
as
if
the
sun
had
had
no
power
to
warm
it
;
but
at
that
time
this
seemed
pleasant
.
Well
,
fond
is
not
the
right
word
.
Tell
me
,
Legolas	B-PER
,
why
did
I
come
on
this
Quest
?
Farewell
,
sweet
Nimrodel	B-PER
!
Look
not
too
far
ahead
!
On_
e
step
down
!
Easy
it
is
now
to
guess
how
quickly
the
roving
eye
of
Saruman	B-PER
was
trapped
and
held
;
and
how
ever
since
he
has
been
persuaded
from
afar
,
and
daunted
when
persuasion
would
not
serve
.
By
all
the
signs
,
Captain
Shagrat	B-PER
,
I
d
say
there
s
a
large
warrior
loose
,
Elf
most
likely
,
with
an
elf
sword
anyway
,
and
an
axe
as
well
maybe
:
and
he
s
loose
in
your
bounds
,
too
,
and
you
ve
never
spotted
him
.
But
that
is
another
story
,
which
can
wait
until
after
lunch
.
Crazy
about
stories
of
the
old
days
he
is
,
and
he
listens
to
all
Mr.
Hobbits
give
presents
to
other
people
on
their
own
birthdays
.
The
Elves
were
gone
.
They
re
coming
along
the
road
from
Waymeet	B-LOC
,
but
a
good
many
stray
ruffians
have
joined
up
with
them
.
That
dark
mind
will
be
filled
now
with
the
voice
and
face
of
the
hobbit
and
with
expectation
:
it
may
take
some
time
before
he
learns
his
error
.
For
though
we
leave
a
host
of
foes
behind
,
what
matter
?
Now
I
have
him
at
the
arrow
point
,
said
Anborn	B-PER
.
High
time
!
Here
the
air
was
still
,
stagnant
,
heavy
,
and
sound
fell
dead
.
The
worst
is
now
over
.
.
Wonder
came
into
his
face
,
and
then
he
smiled
in
answer
.
He
rose
clumsily
and
bowed
in
dwarf
fashion
,
saying
:
Yet
more
fair
is
the
living
land
of
Lorien	B-LOC
,
and
the
Lady
Galadriel	B-PER
is
above
all
the
jewels
that
lie
beneath
the
earth
!
And
why
do
you
come
here
?
But
there
is
no
other
way
out
that
I
can
see
or
think
of
.
Long
has
Boromir	B-PER
son
of
Denethor	B-PER
been
gone
seeking
an
answer
,
and
the
horse
that
we
lent
him
came
back
riderless
.
_Still
round
the
corner
there
may
wait
A
new
road
or
a
secret
gate
;
And
though
I
oft
have
passed
them
by
,
A
day
will
come
at
last
when
I
Shall
take
the
hidden
paths
that
run
West
of
the
Moon
,
East
of
the
Sun
.
He
caught
fish
in
deep
pools
with
invisible
fingers
and
ate
them
raw
.
Twilight
was
about
them
as
they
crept
back
to
the
lane
.
I
wondered
if
you
would
turn
up
.
Aragorn	B-PER
nearly
dropped
him
in
his
amazement
.
Even
old
Gandalf	B-PER
.
Away
shall
fade
!
I
am
glad
that
you
are
here
with
me
,
said
Frodo	B-PER
.
’
said
the
Elf
in
a
hissing
whisper
,
and
cast
on
to
the
flet
the
rope
ladder
rolled
up
.
Where
is
that
silly
fellow
,
Merry	B-PER
?
We
ll
see
.
Or
must
I
do
so
myself
?
And
all
those
close
talks
with
Gandalf	B-PER
.
Death
to
the
Strawheads	B-PER
!
Make
for
Rivendell	B-LOC
.
Well
!
Various
reproachful
names
for
himself
came
to
Sam	B-PER
s
mind
,
drawn
from
the
Gaffer	B-PER
s
large
paternal
word
hoard
;
then
it
also
occurred
to
him
that
his
master
had
been
right
:
there
had
for
the
present
been
nothing
to
guard
against
.
So
you
have
come
back
?
For
just
as
Mablung	B-PER
stepped
towards
the
fallen
body
,
there
was
a
new
noise
.
A
cold
wind
flowed
down
behind
them
,
as
they
turned
their
backs
on
the
Redhorn	B-LOC
Gate	I-LOC
,
and
stumbled
wearily
down
the
slope
.
If
we
get
to
the
other
side
of
this
hill
,
we
shall
find
a
spot
that
is
sheltered
and
snug
enough
,
sir
.
Much
like
Gollum	B-PER
with
his
birthday
present
.
Even
as
he
spoke
,
they
saw
,
as
if
she
came
in
answer
to
their
words
,
the
Lady
Galadriel	B-PER
approaching
.
You
re
forgetting
the
great
big
elvish
warrior
that
s
loose
!
Need
we
think
about
it
yet
?
They
could
all
see
him
standing
,
waving
one
hand
in
the
air
,
the
other
was
in
his
trouser
pocket
.
We
have
other
business
.
For
some
years
he
was
quite
happy
and
did
not
worry
much
about
the
future
.
You
are
all
to
walk
free
,
even
the
dwarf
Gimli	B-PER
.
No
it
isn
t
,
said
Frodo	B-PER
.
My
four
legged
friend
;
though
I
seldom
ride
him
,
and
he
wanders
often
far
,
free
upon
the
hillsides
.
The
marshes
were
at
an
end
,
dying
away
into
dead
peats
and
wide
flats
of
dry
cracked
mud
.
As
soon
as
Gandalf	B-PER
reported
that
you
were
recovered
,
the
preparations
began
.
Certainly
he
had
never
faded
.
A
friendly
light
streamed
out
.
I
shan
t
be
doing
anything
of
the
sort
again
,
Mr.
With
that
he
plunged
in
.
A
few
creatures
came
and
looked
at
them
when
the
fire
had
died
away
.
How
I
wish
it
was
all
over
,
and
well
over
!
No
,
I
ll
go
home
by
the
long
road
with
Mr.
For
he
is
very
wise
,
and
weighs
all
things
to
a
nicety
in
the
scales
of
his
malice
.
Then
there
was
a
dull
rumble
and
a
heavy
thud
.
_
What
,
just
in
time
to
meet
Bilbo	B-PER
?
’
For
some
time
Frodo	B-PER
and
Sam	B-PER
managed
to
keep
up
with
the
others
;
but
Aragorn	B-PER
was
leading
them
at
a
great
pace
,
and
after
a
while
they
lagged
behind
.
I
dare
not
take
it
,
not
even
to
keep
it
safe
,
unused
.
All
I
knew
was
that
you
might
be
found
in
a
wild
region
with
the
uncouth
name
of
Shire	B-LOC
.
They
remained
some
days
in
Lothlorien	B-LOC
,
so
far
as
they
could
tell
or
remember
.
Fill
up
while
I
run
and
see
about
some
food
.
And
if
he
were
given
the
Ring
,
he
would
soon
forget
it
,
or
most
likely
throw
it
away
.
White
mists
began
to
rise
and
curl
on
the
surface
of
the
river
and
stray
about
the
roots
of
the
trees
upon
its
borders
.
They
picked
a
way
among
the
trees
,
and
their
ponies
plodded
along
,
carefully
avoiding
the
many
writhing
and
interlacing
roots
.
Sam	B-PER
thought
he
saw
a
last
fleeting
glimpse
of
it
,
peering
back
over
the
edge
of
the
eastward
precipice
,
before
it
ducked
and
disappeared
.
’
he
said
,
bowing
to
the
hobbits
.
The
west
wind
had
shifted
northward
and
it
was
turning
colder
,
but
the
rain
was
gone
.
help
!
’
With
a
sudden
flick
,
quick
as
lightning
,
an
apple
left
his
hand
and
hit
Bill	B-PER
square
on
the
nose
.
But
most
of
the
traffic
went
out
along
the
chief
highway
,
and
that
turned
south
,
and
then
bending
swifter
than
the
River
skirted
the
hills
and
passed
soon
from
sight
.
All
that
day
the
Company	B-ORG
marched
on
,
until
they
felt
the
cool
evening
come
and
heard
the
early
night
wind
whispering
among
many
leaves
.
A
few
low
trees
grew
there
close
to
the
water
,
and
behind
them
rose
a
steep
rocky
bank
.
Baggins	B-PER
,
said
the
leader
of
the
Shirriffs	B-ORG
,
a
two
feather
hobbit
:
You
re
arrested
for
Gate
breaking
,
and
Tearing
up
of
Rules
,
and
Assaulting
Gate
keepers
,
and
Trespassing
,
and
Sleeping
in
Shire	B-LOC
buildings
without
Leave
,
and
Bribing
Guards
with
Food
.
None
has
ever
caught
him
yet
,
for
Tom	B-PER
,
he
is
the
master
:
His
songs
are
stronger
songs
,
and
his
feet
are
faster
.
I
could
not
!
Though
all
is
now
snow
clad
,
our
path
,
as
we
came
up
,
turned
about
that
shoulder
of
rock
down
yonder
.
I
hope
we
shall
meet
again
some
day
,
when
things
are
merry
once
more
,
said
Frodo	B-PER
.
He
got
out
of
bed
and
discovered
that
his
arm
was
already
nearly
as
useful
again
as
it
ever
had
been
.
Now
let
us
take
our
ease
here
for
a
little
!
It
was
like
watching
the
work
of
great
tree
roots
in
a
hundred
years
,
all
packed
into
a
few
moments
.
I
leave
you
in
good
hands
,
better
than
we
hoped
when
we
hunted
the
orcs
to
Fangorn	B-LOC
.
He
recognized
the
voice
of
the
Marshal
,
Elfhelm	B-PER
.
You’ll
find
his
will
and
all
the
other
documents
in
there
,
I
think
,
’
said
the
wizard
.
I
don
t
know
in
the
least
how
far
down
the
Withywindle	B-LOC
we
are
,
or
who
could
possibly
come
here
often
enough
to
make
a
path
along
it
.
I
d
forgotten
it
,
trying
to
find
you
.
But
so
it
was
that
I
came
to
Rivendell	B-LOC
only
three
days
before
the
Ring
,
and
news
of
its
peril
had
already
been
brought
here
which
proved
well
indeed
.
His
attention
seemed
suddenly
to
be
fixed
on
Pippin	B-PER
.
One
of
the
guards
ran
down
the
stair
.
But
you
comfort
me
,
Gimli	B-PER
,
and
I
am
glad
to
have
you
standing
nigh
with
your
stout
legs
and
your
hard
axe
.
Farewell
!
All
right
!
Don
t
follow
them
!
Small
hobbit
children
ran
after
the
cart
all
through
Hobbiton	B-LOC
and
right
up
the
hill
.
But
I
am
sure
I
do
not
know
where
we
shall
find
more
;
for
all
things
are
amiss
in
these
dreadful
days
,
what
with
fires
and
burnings
,
and
the
lads
that
run
errands
so
few
,
and
all
the
roads
blocked
.
’
Frodo	B-PER
and
Sam	B-PER
stopped
dead
,
but
Pippin	B-PER
walked
on
a
few
paces
.
Indeed
I
have
thought
long
about
it
.
Speed
now
,
fair
guests
!
That
must
be
the
stone
that
marked
the
place
where
the
trolls’
gold
was
hidden
.
Yes
,
my
good
Dwarf
,
he
said
,
it
is
a
comfort
not
to
be
mistaken
at
all
points
.
Not
the
day
I
should
have
chosen
for
letting
the
S
.
But
Pippin	B-PER
found
that
for
the
first
time
he
was
close
to
Merry	B-PER
.
’
You
said
I
might
hear
something
to
my
advantage
,
I
believe
,
’
said
Frodo	B-PER
.
For
Isengard	B-LOC
may
be
ruined
,
yet
he
is
still
safe
in
Orthanc	B-LOC
.
I
often
dream
of
it
.
Then
he
sent
plundering
Orcs
,
and
they
carry
off
what
they
can
,
choosing
always
the
black
horses
:
few
of
these
are
now
left
.
Go
with
words
of
guard
and
guiding
on
you
,
he
said
.
’
said
Merry	B-PER
,
looking
in
.
It
is
dangerous
and
narrow
.
and
glittering
caves
,
and
white
towers
and
golden
halls
,
and
battles
,
and
tall
ships
sailing
,
all
these
passed
before
Sam	B-PER
s
mind
until
he
felt
bewildered
.
said
the
old
man
,
coming
towards
them
.
This
is
my
last
word
,
’
he
said
in
a
low
voice
.
For
the
golden
belt
was
given
to
him
in
Lothlorien	B-LOC
by
the
Lady
Galadriel	B-PER
.
Not
so
the
One
.
That
ain
t
no
secret
.
Perhaps
you
are
thinking
it
won’t
be
too
easy
to
get
to
the
Ferry
without
being
caught
?
Wizards
ought
to
know
better
:
they
do
know
better
.
Only
a
little
higher
now
.
’
He
turned
to
go
back
,
and
then
stopped
,
for
he
heard
voices
,
just
round
the
corner
by
the
end
of
Bagshot	B-LOC
Row	I-LOC
.
Wait
!
You
lie
quiet
,
or
you
ll
pay
for
it
!
They
had
eaten
nothing
since
the
early
morning
.
Treebeard	B-PER
was
at
their
head
,
and
some
fifty
followers
were
behind
him
,
two
abreast
,
keeping
step
with
their
feet
and
beating
time
with
their
hands
upon
their
flanks
.
Now
,
if
you
d
brought
him
along
,
that
might
have
been
useful
if
these
Nazgul
are
all
they
make
out
.
Ring
a
dong
!
Helm
!
Standing
upon
the
rim
of
the
ruined
circle
,
they
saw
all
round
below
them
a
wide
prospect
,
for
the
most
part
of
lands
empty
and
featureless
,
except
for
patches
of
woodland
away
to
the
south
,
beyond
which
they
caught
here
and
there
the
glint
of
distant
water
.
It
s
much
lower
here
than
it
was
,
and
it
looks
easier
too
.
So
now
they
crossed
the
stony
bed
and
took
to
the
orc
path
,
and
for
some
time
they
marched
along
it
.
Already
the
eastward
sky
was
turning
pale
;
the
stars
were
fading
,
and
a
grey
light
was
slowly
growing
.
It
seemed
certainly
to
be
Gandalf	B-PER
s
.
All
the
same
,
I
m
beginning
to
feel
that
if
we
ve
got
to
go
on
,
then
we
d
best
get
it
over
.
cried
Gimli	B-PER
.
There’s
been
a
strange
customer
asking
for
Mr.
I
found
this
,
and
I’m
going
to
keep
it
.
Will
you
really
break
the
doors
of
Isengard	B-LOC
?
’
Still
it
might
be
well
for
all
,
’
said
Gloin	B-PER
the
Dwarf
,
if
all
these
strengths
were
joined
,
and
the
powers
of
each
were
used
in
league
.
Strange
are
the
turns
of
fortune
!
My
lord
,
you
called
me
.
These
they
lashed
together
with
bowstrings
,
and
spread
their
cloaks
upon
the
frame
.
Faint
cries
I
heard
,
and
dim
horns
blowing
,
and
a
murmur
as
of
countless
far
voices
:
it
was
like
the
echo
of
some
forgotten
battle
in
the
Dark
Years
long
ago
.
As
he
struggled
on
he
called
again
,
and
kept
on
calling
more
and
more
frantically
;
but
he
heard
no
answer
for
some
time
,
and
then
it
seemed
faint
and
far
ahead
and
high
above
him
.
The
Lord
of
the
Ring
wraiths
had
met
his
doom
.
It
is
not
so
dark
here
,
said
Th
oden
.
Behind
them
the
sinking
Sun
filled
the
cool
western
sky
with
glimmering
gold
.
At
length
after
fifteen
days
of
journey
the
wain
of
King
Theoden	B-PER
passed
through
the
green
fields
of
Rohan	B-LOC
and
came
to
Edoras	B-LOC
;
and
there
they
all
rested
.
He
is
resting
.
Few
years
,
maybe
,
in
other
places
of
less
royalty
,
my
father
answered
.
_The_
Gollum	B-PER
!
They
felt
as
if
a
trap
was
closing
about
them
;
but
they
did
not
quite
lose
heart
.
Soon
the
rabbits
cut
up
lay
simmering
in
their
pans
with
the
bunched
herbs
.
Here
I
set
it
,
he
said
;
but
I
command
you
not
to
touch
it
,
nor
to
permit
any
other
to
lay
hand
on
it
.
This
is
madness
!
We
don
t
know
.
They
looked
up
at
the
grey
and
yellow
leaves
,
moving
softly
against
the
light
,
and
singing
.
But
tomorrow
fairer
housing
shall
be
found
for
you
.
But
how
comes
it
here
?
awake
!
There
lies
the
Mirrormere	B-LOC
,
and
there
the
River	B-LOC
Silverlode	I-LOC
rises
in
its
icy
springs
.
