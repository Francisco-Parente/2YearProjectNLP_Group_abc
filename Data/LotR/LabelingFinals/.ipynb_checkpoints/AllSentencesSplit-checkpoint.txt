Day
was
coming
again
in
the
world
outside
,
and
far
beyond
the
glooms
of
Mordor	B-LOC
the
Sun
was
climbing
over
the
eastern
rim
of
Middle	B-LOC
earth	I-LOC
;
but
here
all
was
still
dark
as
night
.
# sent_id = anot
Now
be
quiet

# sent_id = anot
Upon
the
east
too
sheer
and
stony
was
the

upon

from
the

,
their
final
doom
approached

can’t

it

He
opened
the
door
,
and
they
followed
him
down
a
short
passage
and
round
a
sharp
turn
.
# sent_id = anot
That
night
they
set
a
watch
,
and
Strider	B-PER
,
it
seemed
,
did
not
sleep
at
all
.
# sent_id = anot
The
others
no

will
make
shift
to
tread
the
path
behind
us

Taking

off

# sent_id = anot
Yet
I
had
caught
no

But
so

my
only
thought
has
been
to
get
here

I
hope
I
shan’t
have
to
go
any
further

Does
he
think
that
men
sleep
without
watch
all
night

No

is
gone

said
Eowyn	B-PER
turning
away

looking
at
the
mountains
dark
against
the
East

South

# sent_id = anot
Clear

thy

# sent_id = anot
And
after
what
has
happened
tonight
another
will
come

I
think
,
and
swiftly
.
# sent_id = anot
He
was
no
longer
holding
the
Ring
,
but
it
was
there
,
a
hidden
power
,
a
cowing
menace
to
the
slaves
of
Mordor B-LOC
;
and
in
his
hand
was
Sting
,
and
its
light
smote
the
eyes
of
the
orc
like
the
glitter
of
cruel
stars
in
the
terrible
elf
countries
,
the
dream
of
which
was
a
cold
fear
to
all
his
kind
.
# sent_id = anot
Forgive
me
,
but
that
too
must
be
left
at
the
doors
.
# sent_id = anot
said
Merry B-PER
.
# sent_id = anot
And
now
Faramir	B-PER
was
gone
again
.
# sent_id = anot
Otherwise
he
obviously
thought
the
whole
thing
rather
above
my
head
,
and
he
said
that
if
I
had
the
cheek
to
make
verses
about
Earendil	B-PER
in
the
house
of
Elrond	B-PER
,
it
was
my
affair
.
# sent_id = anot
He

no
strength

match
you

# sent_id = anot
said
Gandalf	B-PER
,
and
for
a
moment
it
seemed
that
a
cloud
of
pain
passed
over
his
face
,
and
he
sat
silent
,
looking
old
as
death
.
# sent_id = anot
The
doors
rolled
back
and
a
keen
air
came
whistling
in
.
# sent_id = anot
It
shall
be

lord

command

# sent_id = anot

He
stands
a
fair
chance

being
spitted
for
an
Orc

of
being
roasted
by
the
Yellow	B-PER
Face	I-PER

# sent_id = anot
I
reached
here
at

by
a
long
hard
road

up
the
Hoarwell	B-LOC

through

They
felt
their
way
along
the
water’s
edge
for
some
distance

until
they
found
a
small
shallow
bay

# sent_id = anot

Sam	B-PER
had
changed
before
his
very
eyes
into
an
orc
again
,
leering
and
pawing
at
his
treasure

a
foul
little
creature
with
greedy
eyes

What
have
you
to
say
now
,
Frodo	B-PER
!
# sent_id = anot
He
was
on
a
dark
heath
,
and
there
was
a
strange
salt
smell
in
the
air
.
# sent_id = anot
And
all
the
lands
that
you
see
,
and
those
that
lie
round
about

shall
be
dwellings

Men

# sent_id = anot
They
always
wished
to
talk
to
everything

the
old
Elves
did

# sent_id = anot
He
returned
to
the
bank
,
close
to
where
the
rill
from
the
spring
trickled
out
into
the
River
.
# sent_id = anot
They
felt
that
he
would
know
how
to
deal
with
Black	B-ORG
Riders	I-ORG
,
if
anyone
did
.
# sent_id = anot
If
once
he
could
do
that
impossible
thing
,
then
somehow
the
errand
would
be
accomplished
,
or
so
it
seemed
to
him
in
that
dark
hour
of
weariness
,
still
labouring
in
the
stony
shadows
under
Cirith	B-LOC
Ungol	I-LOC

# sent_id = anot
Curtains
of

blown

slanting
down

# sent_id = anot
The
three
Riders
that
were
still
in
the
midst
of
the
Ford
were
overwhelmed
:
they
disappeared
,
buried
suddenly
under
angry
foam
.
# sent_id = anot
I
wish
that
there
were
leisure
now
to
walk
among
them
:
they
have
voices
,
and
in
time
I
might
come
to
understand
their
thought

# sent_id = anot
The
Orcs
must
have
been
aware
from
this
point
that
they
were
pursued
;
they
may
have
made
some
attempt
to
get
their
captives
away
before
they
were
overtaken

# sent_id = anot
I
do
not

with

it

the
grim

up
invisible
in

In
the

they
went
on

walking
without

Ever
my
heart
rises
as
we
draw

What
was
the

were
there
many

He
took
his

bent

I
will
lead

That

not
happened
in

Forest

the
wars
of
Sauron	B-PER

the
Men	B-ORG

But
you
speak
of
him
as

he
was
a
friend
.
# sent_id = anot
But
I
do
not
desire
healing

she
said

# sent_id = anot
We
do
not
want
the
escapes
of
Mirkwood	B-LOC

# sent_id = anot
I
will
follow
your
lead
now
if
this
last
warning

move
you

Long
she
had
been
in
the
land
of
her
mother’s
kin
,
in
Lorien	B-LOC
beyond
the
mountains
,
and
was
but
lately
returned
to
Rivendell	B-LOC

her
father’s
house

And
then
we
can
have
some
rest
and
some
sleep
,
said
Sam	B-PER
.
# sent_id = anot
He
remained
on
visiting
terms
with
his
relatives
(
except
,
of
course
,
the
Sackville	B-PER
Bagginses	I-PER
)
,
and
he
had
many
devoted
admirers
among
the
hobbits
of
poor
and
unimportant
families
.
# sent_id = anot
I
regret
to
announce
that
though
,
as
I
said
,
eleventy
one
years
is
far
too
short
a
time
to
spend
among
you
this
is
the
END

# sent_id = anot
He
stood
up
and
cast
open
his
long
black
cloak
,
and
behold
!
# sent_id = anot
But
defenders
and
foes
alike
gave
up
the
battle
and
fled
when
we
came
,
crying
out
that
the
King	B-PER
of	I-PER
the	I-PER
Dead	I-PER
was
upon
them
.
# sent_id = anot
So
much
I
have
heard
but
no
more
.
# sent_id = anot
It
has
been
treasured
by
his
heirs
when
all
other
heirlooms
were
lost
;
for
it
was
spoken
of
old
among
us
that
it
should
be
made
again
when
the
Ring
,
Isildur	B-PER

Bane

was
found

The
wind
had
been
turning
through

during
the
night

and
now
it
failed

He
laughed
again
,
seeing
the
dismay
in
Pippin	B-PER

face

# sent_id = anot

flying
over

he
said

I
think
that
this
task
is
appointed
for
you
,
Frodo	B-PER
;
and
that
if
you
do
not
find
a
way
,
no
one
will
.
# sent_id = anot
Maybe
he
was
called

said
Theoden	B-PER
;

my
heart
tells
me
that
I
shall
not

him
again

On
down
the
grey
road
they
went
beside
the
Snowbourn	B-LOC
rushing
on
its
stones
;
through
the
hamlets
of
Underharrow	B-LOC
and
Upbourn	B-LOC
,
where
many
sad
faces
of
women
looked
out
from
dark
doors
;
and
so
without
horn
or
harp
or
music
of
men
s
voices
the
great
ride
into
the
East
began
with
which
the
songs
of
Rohan	B-LOC
were
busy
for
many
long
lives
of
men
thereafter

# sent_id = anot
he
cried
.
# sent_id = anot
At
last
they
reached
the
crest
of
the
grey
hill
,
and
a
sudden
breeze
blew
in
their
hair
and
stirred
their
cloaks
:
the
chill
wind
of
dawn
.
# sent_id = anot
They
were
the
hobbits
chief
source
of
news
from
distant
parts
if
they
wanted
any

as
a
rule
dwarves
said
little

hobbits
asked
no

Some
,
doubtless
,
were
no
better
than
tramps

ready
to
dig
a
hole
in
any
bank

stay
only
as
long

it
suited

Sam	B-PER
took
his
master

hands
and
laid
them
together

palm

and
kissed
them
;

then
he
held
them
gently
between
his

now

Many
words

Sam	B-PER
quickly
blushed

hung
his
head

# sent_id = anot
They
seem
to
have
made
a
last
stand
by
both
doors

he
said
;
but
there
were
not

left
by
that
time

# sent_id = anot
We

departed

Ah

Frodo	B-PER

chilled
to

the
Moon

falling
into

Is
Rivendell	B-LOC

Inside
it
was
damp

supper

Indeed

Bill	B-PER

seeming

nuzzled
up

putting

If
they
held
to
their
pace

then
at
sundown
yesterday
they
would
reach

off

bent
over

glittered

raised

she
said
bitterly

# sent_id = anot
Suddenly
he
stopped
and
waved
his
arms
.
# sent_id = anot
But
we
have
got
to
try

get
there

and
it
won’t
be
done

Hence
the
excitement
of
the
hobbit
children
.
# sent_id = anot
Sometimes
in
the
silence
of
that
barren
country
they
fancied
that
they
heard
faint
sounds
behind
them

a

falling
,

the
imagined
step
of
flapping
feet
on
the
rock

# sent_id = anot
Over

go

# sent_id = anot
He
walked
briskly
back
to
his
hole
,
and
stood
for
a
moment
listening
with
a
smile
to
the
din
in
the
pavilion
and
to
the
sounds
of
merrymaking
in
other
parts

the
field

his
now

mine

# sent_id = anot
said
Sam	B-PER
pointing
to
the

# sent_id = anot
Quite
simple

# sent_id = anot
Then
Boromir	B-PER
had
come
leaping
through
the
trees
.
# sent_id = anot
Well
,
now
we
must
halt
again
and
wear
the
night
away

# sent_id = anot
Travellers
shiver
when
they
see
it
,
they
creep
out
of
sight
,
they
avoid
its
shadow

# sent_id = anot
They
rode
across

looked
northwards

# sent_id = anot
You
make
that
clearer
with

He
dared
not

up

Good

Sam	B-PER

# sent_id = anot
It
is
well

I
did

for

have
several

cross

is
needed

He
ran
to
the
ponies
and
before
long
came
back
with
two
tinder
boxes
and
a
hatchet
.
# sent_id = anot
But
anyway
you
do
not
seem
to
fit

He
felt
desperate
:
lost
and
witless
.
# sent_id = anot
They
went
forward
steadily
,
but
they
soon
saw
that
the
Road
was
further
away
than
they
had
imagined
.
# sent_id = anot
I
was
mortally
afraid
,
of
course
;
but
if
I
had
known
more
,
I
should
not

dared
even
to
move

He
shivered

# sent_id = anot
What
are

doing

# sent_id = anot
she
cried
to
those
about

# sent_id = anot
I
saw
nothing
,

I
didn’t
stop
to
look

# sent_id = anot
While
they
were
still
able
to
give
heed
to
such
things
,
they
could
hear
his
breath
hissing
and
gasping
just
in
front
of
them

# sent_id = anot
As
far
as
their
eyes
could
reach
,
along
the
skirts
of
the
Morgai	B-LOC
and
away
southward

there
were
camps

some
of

some
ordered

small
towns

said
Strider	B-PER

# sent_id = anot
We
must
be
getting
off
at
once

# sent_id = anot
Some
of
us
are
still
true
Ents
,
and
lively
enough
in
our
fashion

but
many
are
growing
sleepy
,
going

as
you
might
say

# sent_id = anot
Certainly

said
Gandalf	B-PER
.
# sent_id = anot
There
was
a
cold
gleam
in
it

# sent_id = anot
He
was
a
funny
customer
and
asking
funny
questions
.
# sent_id = anot
But
you
need
ask
no
questions

# sent_id = anot
It
is
clad
in
a
forest

dark
fir

where
the
trees
strive
one
against

rot
and
wither

# sent_id = anot
Good
night

# sent_id = anot
Again
Gandalf	B-PER
approached
the
wall
,
and
lifting
up
his
arms
he
spoke
in
tones
of
command
and
rising
wrath
.
# sent_id = anot
And
what
was
said
therein
was
already
known
.
# sent_id = anot
But
what
did
I
say
?
# sent_id = anot
Then
they
wrapped
themselves
warmly
,
not
only
in
the
fur
cloaks
of
the
Elves
,
but
in
their
own
blankets
as
well
,
and
tried
to
go
to
sleep

# sent_id = anot
It
would
take
more
than
such
an
orc
scratch
to
keep
me
back

# sent_id = anot
At
the
feet
of
the
trees
,
and
all
about
the
green
hillsides
the
grass
was
studded
with
small
golden
flowers
shaped
like
stars

# sent_id = anot
One

wondering

said
Aragorn	B-PER

There
are
some
things

it
is
better

begin

refuse

even
though
the
end
may
be

# sent_id = anot
Then
if
you
will
have
it
so
,
lady

he
said
:
you
do
not
go

because
only
your
brother
called
for
you

and
to
look
on
the
Lord
Aragorn	B-PER
,
Elendil	B-PER

heir

in
his
triumph
would
now
bring
you
no
joy

# sent_id = anot
But
in
this
I
judge
that
you
speak
the
truth

# sent_id = anot
I
will
not
speak
of
that
journey

# sent_id = anot
Sleepily
he
tried
to
reckon
the
times
and
stages
of
their
journey

but
his
memory
was
drowsy
and
uncertain

# sent_id = anot
Such
words

# sent_id = anot
Sam	B-PER
scowled
at
him
,
and
sucked
his
teeth

he
seemed
to
sense
that
there
was
something
odd
about
his
master

mood
and
that
the
matter
was
beyond
argument

# sent_id = anot
He
drew
a
deep
breath

# sent_id = anot
He
had
a
blue
coat
and
a
long
brown
beard

his
eyes
were
blue
and
bright
,
and
his
face
was
red
as

creased
into
a
hundred
wrinkles

laughter

And
the
Eagles
of
the

went
far

they
saw
many
things

the
gathering

wolves
and
the
mustering
of
Ores

and
the
Nine	B-PER
Riders	I-PER
going
hither
and
thither
in

and
they
heard
news
of
the
escape

Gollum	B-PER

# sent_id = anot
Pippin	B-PER
fell
asleep

pillowed

green
hillock

In
panoply

he
armoured

his

scored
with

ward
all

his
bow
was
made

his

shorn

his

his
scabbard

his

he
felt

more
urgent

the

put

the

the
water
grew
less
,
and
the
shadow
of
the
eastern
bank
faded
back
into
the
night

# sent_id = anot
I
hoped
that
Frodo	B-PER
had
set
forth
at
once
,
as
my
letter
had
urged
,
and
that
he
had
reached
Rivendell	B-LOC
before
the
deadly
pursuit
began
.
# sent_id = anot
Indeed
I
alone
can
aid
you
now
.
# sent_id = anot
Give
it
to
me
!
# sent_id = anot
And
as
he
did
so
a
great
fear
fell
on
all
,
defender
and
foe
alike
;
and
the
hands
of
men
drooped
to
their
sides
,
and
no
bow
sang
.
# sent_id = anot
Wait
a
few
minutes
for
me
at
the
bottom
,
but
if
I
do
not
come
soon

go
on
!
# sent_id = anot
I
said
.
# sent_id = anot
But
I
was
not
here
then
.
# sent_id = anot
Even
the
leaves
were
silent
,
and
the
very
falls
seemed
to
be
hushed
.
# sent_id = anot
said
Merry	B-PER
and
Pippin	B-PER
together
,
and
they
turned
away
hastily
.
# sent_id = anot
We
ve
escaped
from
the
Emyn	B-LOC
Muil	I-LOC

# sent_id = anot
Whatever
they
have
to
eat
and

we
can

get
it
.
# sent_id = anot
They
came
a
few
timid
steps
further
into
the
room
,
and
began
to
bow
low
,
feeling
strangely
surprised
and
awkward
,
like
folk
that
,
knocking
at
a
cottage
door
to
beg
for
a
drink
of
water
,
have
been
answered
by
a
fair
young
elf
queen
clad
in
living
flowers

# sent_id = anot
Through
Lorien	B-LOC
we
came
of
which
it
were
well
that
you
should
learn
the
truth
ere
you
speak
of
it
again
and
thence
down
the
leagues
of
the
Great
River
to
the
falls
of
Rauros	B-LOC
.
# sent_id = anot
No
word
did
he
ever
speak
of
it
to
any
of
the
Council	B-ORG

# sent_id = anot
Frodo	B-PER
was
sitting
at
a
table
with
a

Believe
what
you
will

there

scale
the
pathless
mountains

or
swim
the

all
alone

# sent_id = anot
Sam	B-PER
smiled
grimly
at
this
description
of
himself
.
# sent_id = anot
cried
Boromir	B-PER
and
leaped
after
him
.
# sent_id = anot
And
soon
the
word
had
gone
out
from
the
House
that
the
king
was
indeed
come
among
them
,
and
after
war
he
brought
healing
;
and
the
news
ran
through
the
City
.
# sent_id = anot
Overhead
there
hung
a
heavy
roof
,
sombre
and
featureless
,
and
light
seemed
rather
to
be
failing
than
growing
.
# sent_id = anot
Worse
,
there
was
a
whole
line
of
the
ugly
new
houses
all
along
Pool
Side
,
where
the
Hobbiton	B-LOC
Road	I-LOC
ran
close
to
the
bank
.
# sent_id = anot
And
long
listening’s
hungry
work
,
morning
,
noon
,
and
evening
!
# sent_id = anot
To
the
amazement
of
the
others
,
Saruman	B-PER
turned
again
.
# sent_id = anot
The
Lady
Eowyn	B-PER
is
she
,
sister
of
Eomer	B-PER
;
and
we
knew
naught
of
her
riding
until
this
hour
,
and
greatly
we
rue
it
.
# sent_id = anot
Others
were
still
coming
in
by
twos
and
threes
through
a
dark
narrow
door
on
one
side
.
# sent_id = anot
Beside
the
way
in
a
stone
channel
a
stream
of
clear
water
flowed
,
sparkling
and
chattering
.
# sent_id = anot
By
night
they
had
reached
the
feet
of
the
westward
slopes
,
and
there
they
camped
.
# sent_id = anot
For
in
the
days
of
Isildur	B-PER
the
Ruling
Ring
passed
out
of
all
knowledge
,
and
the
Three
were
released
from
its
dominion
.
# sent_id = anot
And
then
Faramir	B-PER
cried
:
Behold
the
King
!
# sent_id = anot
Five
and
forty
leagues
as
the
crow
flies
we
have
come
,
though
many
long
miles
further
our
feet
have
walked
.
# sent_id = anot
He
sprang
forward
to
Boromir’s	B-PER
side
and
drew
himself
up
to
his
full
height
.
# sent_id = anot
I
hope
it
won’t
come
to
that
!
# sent_id = anot
The
growing
light
revealed
to
them
a
land
already
,
less
barren
and
ruinous
.
# sent_id = anot
I
do
not
know
the
reason
for
your
flight
,
and
therefore
I
do
not
know
by
what
means
your
pursuers
will
assail
you
.
# sent_id = anot
’
Where
did
you
learn
such
tales
,
if
all
the
land
is
empty
and
forgetful
?
# sent_id = anot
They
seem
to
like
them
as
much
as
food
,
or
more
.
# sent_id = anot
Yes
,
we
certainly
must
decide
what
to
do
at
once
,
answered
Strider	B-PER
,
looking
up
and
considering
the
time
and
the
weather
.
# sent_id = anot
At
last
they
came
suddenly
into
a
thin
shade
;
great
grey
branches
reached
across
the
path
.
# sent_id = anot
At
that
moment
Boromir	B-PER
reappeared
.
# sent_id = anot
This
is
what
I
have
really
been
longing
for
,
for
years
!
# sent_id = anot
It
fell
upon
his
ears
like
the
echo
of
all
the
joys
he
had
ever
known
.
# sent_id = anot
At
first
it
seemed
to
the
hobbits
that
although
they
walked
and
stumbled
until
they
were
weary
,
they
were
creeping
forward
like
snails
,
and
getting
nowhere
.
# sent_id = anot
I
would
give
them
Bag	B-LOC
End	I-LOC
and
everything
else
,
if
I
could
get
Bilbo	B-PER
back
and
go
off
tramping
in
the
country
with
him
.
# sent_id = anot
Between
them
they
turned
the
whole
place
upside
down
.
# sent_id = anot
How
long
will
the
day
tarry
?
# sent_id = anot
Yes
,
alas
!
# sent_id = anot
I
had
a
funny
dream
an
hour
or
two
before
we
stopped
,
Mr.
They
hate
us
far
more
,
altogether
and
all
the
time
.
# sent_id = anot
But
then
he
turned
aside
.
# sent_id = anot
But
say
on
!
# sent_id = anot
He
came
,
a
weary
man
with
dinted
helm
and
cloven
shield
.
# sent_id = anot
Or
if
you
desire
it
,
we
will
come
to
Rohan	B-LOC
and
bring
him
back
to
rest
with
his
own
people
.
# sent_id = anot
The
wind
s
changing

said
Merry	B-PER
.
# sent_id = anot
More
deadly
to
him
was
the
name
of
Elbereth	B-PER

They
had
not
gone

Frodo	B-PER
paused

came
forth
to

To

begging
your
pardon

he
added

turned

know

# sent_id = anot
I
was
only
fifty
one
then
,
and
birthdays
did
not
seem
so
important
.
# sent_id = anot
But
you
must
admit
that
it
was
very
intriguing
,
and
I
was
only
in
my
teens
.
# sent_id = anot
It
was
cool
,
as
if
the
sun
had
had
no
power
to
warm
it
;
but
at
that
time
this
seemed
pleasant
.
# sent_id = anot
Well

fond

not
the
right
word

# sent_id = anot
Tell

Legolas	B-PER

Quest

Easy
it
is
now
to
guess
how
quickly
the
roving
eye
of
Saruman	B-PER
was
trapped
and
held
;
and
how
ever
since
he
has
been
persuaded
from
afar
,
and
daunted
when
persuasion
would
not
serve
.
# sent_id = anot
By
all
the
signs
,
Captain
Shagrat	B-PER
,
I
d
say
there
s
a
large
warrior
loose
,
Elf
most
likely
,
with
an
elf
sword
anyway
,
and
an
axe
as
well
maybe
:
and
he
s
loose
in
your
bounds
,
too
,
and
you
ve
never
spotted
him
.
# sent_id = anot
But
that
is
another
story
,
which
can
wait
until
after
lunch
.
# sent_id = anot
Crazy
about
stories
of
the
old
days
he
is
,
and
he
listens
to
all
Mr.
Hobbits
give
presents
to
other
people
on
their
own
birthdays

# sent_id = anot
The
Elves
were
gone

# sent_id = anot
They
re
coming
along
the
road
from
Waymeet	B-LOC

but
a
good
many
stray
ruffians
have
joined
up
with
them

# sent_id = anot
That
dark
mind
will
be
filled
now
with
the
voice
and
face
of
the
hobbit
and
with
expectation
:
it
may
take
some
time
before
he
learns
his
error
.
# sent_id = anot
For
though
we
leave
a
host
of
foes
behind

what
matter

# sent_id = anot
Now
I

Anborn	B-PER

High

Here
the

The
worst
is
now
over

# sent_id = anot

# sent_id = anot
Wonder
came
into
his
face
,
and
then
he
smiled
in
answer
.
# sent_id = anot
He
rose
clumsily
and
bowed
in
dwarf
fashion
,
saying
:
Yet
more
fair
is
the
living
land
of
Lorien	B-LOC

and
the
Lady
Galadriel	B-PER
is
above
all
the

why
do
you
come
here

# sent_id = anot
But
there
is
no
other
way
out

# sent_id = anot
Long
has
Boromir	B-PER
son

gone
seeking

riderless

Various
reproachful
names

came
to
Sam	B-PER

mind
,
drawn
from
the
Gaffer	B-PER

large
paternal
word

then
it
also
occurred
to
him
that
his
master

been
right

there
had
for

nothing

guard

So
you
have
come
back

For
just
as
Mablung	B-PER
stepped
towards
the
fallen
body

there
was
a
new
noise

# sent_id = anot
A
cold
wind
flowed
down
behind
them
,
as
they
turned
their
backs
on
the
Redhorn	B-LOC
Gate	I-LOC

and
stumbled
wearily
down
the
slope

# sent_id = anot
If

we
shall
find

snug
enough

# sent_id = anot
Much
like
Gollum	B-PER
with
his
birthday
present

# sent_id = anot
Even
as

spoke

they
saw

as

came
in
answer

their
words

the
Lady

approaching

They
could
all
see

standing

waving

hand
in
the
air

the
other
was
in
his
trouser
pocket

# sent_id = anot
We
have
other
business

For
some

quite

The
marshes
were
at
an
end

dying
away
into
dead
peats

wide
flats

dry
cracked
mud

# sent_id = anot
As
soon
as

reported
that
you
were
recovered
,
the
preparations
began
.
# sent_id = anot
Certainly
he
had
never
faded

A
friendly
light
streamed
out
.
# sent_id = anot
I
shan

be
doing
anything

Mr.
With
that
he
plunged

A
few
creatures
came

looked
at

For
some

Frodo	B-PER

to
keep
up
with
the
others

Aragorn	B-PER
was
leading
them
at
a
great
pace

after
a

they
lagged
behind

I
dare
not
take
it

not
even

keep

safe

unused

All
I
knew
was
that
you
might
be
found
in
a
wild
region
with
the
uncouth
name
of
Shire	B-LOC

some

Fill
up

if

White
mists
began
to
rise
and
curl
on
the
surface

the
river

stray
about
the
roots

the

upon
its
borders

They
picked
a

along

carefully
avoiding

writhing

interlacing

Sam	B-PER

a

fleeting
glimpse

peering
back
over

before
it
ducked

With
a

an

left
his

hit

But
most
of
the

went
out

take

it

He
turned

stopped

heard

just
round

at

some
fifty

behind
him

two
abreast

keeping

beating

Standing
upon
the
rim
of
the
ruined
circle

they
saw
all
round
below
them
a
wide
prospect
,
for
the
most
part
of
lands
empty
and
featureless
,
except
for
patches

woodland
away
to
the

beyond

they
caught
here

there
the
glint

water

It
s
much
lower

So
now
they
crossed

took
to

Faint
cries
I
heard

dim
horns
blowing

a

called

more
frantically

he
heard
no

then
it
seemed
faint

view
:
they
were
up
on
the
hill
,
perhaps
,
or
hidden
in
the
bracken
.
# sent_id = anot
It
was
a
misty
,
moisty
morning
when
we
climbed
down
and
looked
round
again
,
and
nobody
was
about
.
# sent_id = anot
And
now
I
think
I’ll
be
getting
to
bed
.
# sent_id = anot
Great
deed
was
the
riding
of
the
Paths	B-LOC
of	I-LOC
the	I-LOC
Dead	I-LOC
,
and
great
it
shall
remain
,
though
none
be
left
in
Gondor	B-LOC
to
sing
of
it
in
the
days
that
are
to
come
.
# sent_id = anot
The
feast
was
merry
and
the
food
all
that
his
hunger
could
desire
.
# sent_id = anot
But
something
held
him
back
.
# sent_id = anot
I
hope
that
you
ll
not
take
it
amiss
.
# sent_id = anot
If
that
isn't
the
very
tree
you
hid
behind
when
the
Black	B-PER
Rider	I-PER
first
showed
up
,
Mr.
Frodo	B-PER
!
# sent_id = anot
said
Sam	B-PER
pointing
to
the
left
.
# sent_id = anot
The
worthies
of
Bree	B-LOC
will
be
dis
cussing
it
a
hundred
years
hence
.
# sent_id = anot
Nay
,
there
was
no
change
of
counsel
,
said
the
Lady
Galadriel	B-PER
speaking
for
the
first
time
.
# sent_id = anot
He
was
covered
with
green
slime
.
# sent_id = anot
Sméagol	B-PER
will
swear
never
,
never
,
to
let
Him
have
it
.
# sent_id = anot
It
is
not
my
will
,
he
said
,
to
put
aside
my
sword
or
to
deliver
And
ril
to
the
hand
of
any
other
man
.
# sent_id = anot
He
felt
that
black
shapes
were
advancing
to
smother
him
;
but
when
he
sat
up
he
saw
nothing
but
the
back
of
Strider	B-PER
sitting
hunched
up
,
smoking
his
pipe
,
and
watching
.
# sent_id = anot
This
is
Sting
.
# sent_id = anot
It
was
not
bird
or
beast
,
said
Frodo	B-PER
.
# sent_id = anot
They
have
no
need
to
ride
to
war
;
war
already
marches
on
their
own
lands
.
# sent_id = anot
Then
we
are
all
men
here
.
# sent_id = anot
Now
tell
me
all
about
it
!
# sent_id = anot
I
guess
that
you
have
been
having
adventures
,
which
was
not
quite
fair
without
me
.
# sent_id = anot
He
searched
the
wound
on
Frodo's	B-PER
shoulder
with
his
fingers
,
and
his
face
grew
graver
,
as
if
what
he
learned
disquieted
him
.
# sent_id = anot
Frar	B-PER
and
Loni	B-PER
and
Nali	B-PER
fell
there
.
# sent_id = anot
All
that
Frodo	B-PER
and
Sam	B-PER
knew
of
this
last
mile
of
the
road
they
learned
from
guessing
in
the
dark
.
# sent_id = anot
I
am
going
to
have
a
long
talk
with
Bombadil	B-PER
:
such
a
talk
as
I
have
not
had
in
all
my
time
.
# sent_id = anot
What
had
come
over
them
?
# sent_id = anot
Why
had
they
dashed
off
like
that
,
taking
no
notice
of
old
Strider	B-PER
?
# sent_id = anot
They
had
run
a
long
way
shouting
he
could
not
remember
how
far
or
how
long
;
and
then
suddenly
they
had
crashed
right
into
a
group
of
Orcs
:
they
were
standing
listening
,
and
they
did
not
appear
to
see
Merry	B-PER
and
Pippin	B-PER
until
they
were
almost
in
their
arms
.
# sent_id = anot
It
is
wretched
for
us
all
,
but
it
is
no
use
your
trying
to
keep
me
.
# sent_id = anot
Every
now
and
again
they
caught
,
among
many
a
_derry
dol_
and
a
_merry
dol_
and
a
_ring
a
ding
dillo_
the
repeated
words
:
Old
Tom	B-PER
Bombadil	I-PER
is
a
merry
fellow
;
Bright
blue
his
jacket
is
,
and
his
boots
are
yellow
.
# sent_id = anot
Fly
,
if
you
value
your
foul
skin
!
# sent_id = anot
I
will
shrivel
you
from
tail
to
snout
,
if
you
come
within
this
ring
.
# sent_id = anot
Frodo	B-PER
!
# sent_id = anot
Mr.
Frodo	B-PER
,
my
dear
!
# sent_id = anot
cried
Sam	B-PER
,
tears
almost
blinding
him
.
# sent_id = anot
Tell
us
of
Gil-galad	B-LOC
,
said
Merry	B-PER
suddenly
,
when
he
paused
at
the
end
of
a
story
of
the
Elf	B-LOC
Kingdoms	I-LOC
.
# sent_id = anot
Dangerous
indeed
,
but
not
to
all
,
said
Aragorn	B-PER
.
# sent_id = anot
When
Frodo	B-PER
was
asleep
Sam	B-PER
bent
over
him
and
listened
to
his
breathing
and
scanned
his
face
.
# sent_id = anot
And
those
that
watched
felt
that
some
great
struggle
was
going
on
.
# sent_id = anot
I
will
send
out
messages
,
such
as
I
can
contrive
,
to
those
whom
I
know
in
the
wide
world
;
but
so
perilous
are
the
lands
now
become
that
some
may
well
mis
carry
,
or
come
no
quicker
than
you
yourself
.
# sent_id = anot
Ahead
there
loomed
now
against
the
dusky
sky
the
bleak
and
treeless
backs
of
the
hills
.
# sent_id = anot
We
are
all
friends
here
.
# sent_id = anot
Both
father
and
son
were
on
very
friendly
terms
with
Bilbo	B-PER
and
Frodo	B-PER
.
# sent_id = anot
The
trees
were
the
worst
loss
and
damage
,
for
at
Sharkey's	B-PER
bidding
they
had
been
cut
down
recklessly
far
and
wide
over
the
Shire	B-LOC
;
and
Sam	B-PER
grieved
over
this
more
than
anything
else
.
# sent_id = anot
He
thrust
and
pushed
at
the
block
,
and
he
threw
himself
against
it
,
but
it
did
not
yield
.
# sent_id = anot
Are
you
going
any
further
?
# sent_id = anot
Yes
,
I
am
.
# sent_id = anot
What
?
# sent_id = anot
_Me_
take
the
Ring
from
_him_
?
# sent_id = anot
The
Council	B-ORG
gave
it
to
him
.
# sent_id = anot
The
drink
in
their
drinking
bowls
seemed
to
be
clear
cold
water
,
yet
it
went
to
their
hearts
like
wine
and
set
free
their
voices
.
# sent_id = anot
Shadows
rose
behind
and
reached
out
long
arms
from
the
East
.
# sent_id = anot
Then
I
was
weary
,
very
weary
;
and
I
walked
long
in
dark
thought
.
# sent_id = anot
Frodo	B-PER
coming
behind
grabbed
his
leg
and
threw
him
.
# sent_id = anot
Overcome
with
weakness
he
wept
.
# sent_id = anot
He's
over
there
,
he
cackled
.
# sent_id = anot
O
yes
indeed
there
is
.
# sent_id = anot
Is
that
enough
for
you
?
# sent_id = anot
The
Bree	B-LOC
folk
used
to
be
fair
spoken
to
travellers
,
or
so
I
had
heard
.
# sent_id = anot
There
is
a
dry
fir
wood
just
ahead
,
if
I
remember
rightly
.
# sent_id = anot
Fire
shall
devour
the
high
seat
.
# sent_id = anot
Then
he
and
Frodo	B-PER
went
off
with
Farmer
Cotton	B-PER
.
# sent_id = anot
Whither
do
you
run
,
Master
Peregrin	B-PER
?
# sent_id = anot
he
cried
.
# sent_id = anot
I
think
you
look
fine
,
Sam	B-PER
,
she
said
.
# sent_id = anot
I
can
only
suppose
that
he
had
seen
Gandalf	B-PER
or
had
some
news
of
him
,
but
would
not
say
anything
in
a
hurry
.
# sent_id = anot
He
straddled
one
of
these
,
and
paddled
his
hot
feet
in
the
cool
brown
water
;
and
there
he
too
suddenly
fell
asleep
with
his
back
against
the
tree
.
# sent_id = anot
Of
course
he’s
had
a
bit
of
schooling
,
so
to
speak
we
all
have
since
we
left
home
,
or
he’d
be
so
terrified
he’d
just
fling
the
Ring
in
the
River
and
bolt
.
# sent_id = anot
I
have
been
so
taken
up
with
the
thoughts
of
leaving
Bag	B-LOC
End	I-LOC
,
and
of
saying
farewell
,
that
I
have
never
even
considered
the
direction
,
said
Frodo	B-PER
.
# sent_id = anot
I
told
Bilbo	B-PER
often
that
such
rings
were
better
left
unused
;
but
he
resented
it
,
and
soon
got
angry
.
# sent_id = anot
I
know
we
are
going
to
take
a
very
long
road
,
into
darkness
;
but
I
know
I
can't
turn
back
.
# sent_id = anot
Thither
,
eastward
,
unwilling
his
eye
was
drawn
.
# sent_id = anot
But
he's
got
you
,
you
nassty
filthy
little
sneak
!
# sent_id = anot
He
spat
on
Sam's	B-PER
neck
.
# sent_id = anot
Sam	B-PER
stepped
back
and
braced
his
feet
against
a
stump
a
yard
or
two
from
the
edge
.
# sent_id = anot
Every
now
and
again
a
tiny
red
gleam
far
away
flickered
upwards
on
the
rim
of
earth
and
sky
.
# sent_id = anot
A
few
miles
to
the
north
east
the
foothills
of
the
Ashen	B-LOC
Mountains	I-LOC
stood
like
sombre
grey
ghosts
,
behind
which
the
misty
northern
heights
rose
like
a
line
of
distant
cloud
hardly
darker
than
the
lowering
sky
.
# sent_id = anot
From
inside
the
hood
came
a
noise
as
of
someone
sniffing
to
catch
an
elusive
scent
;
the
head
turned
from
side
to
side
of
the
road
.
# sent_id = anot
Curse
him
!
# sent_id = anot
No
sooner
had
he
slipped
us
and
run
off
than
word
came
he's
wanted
alive
,
wanted
quick
.
# sent_id = anot
And
they
became
our
allies
,
and
have
ever
proved
true
to
us
,
aiding
us
at
need
,
and
guarding
our
northern
marches
and
the
Gap	B-LOC
of	B-LOC
Rohan	B-LOC
.
# sent_id = anot
The
Ring
is
another
:
you
are
the
Ring
bearer
.
# sent_id = anot
Yet
we
are
hard
pressed
,
and
the
Sword
of
Elendil	B-PER
would
be
a
help
beyond
our
hope
if
such
a
thing
could
indeed
return
out
of
the
shadows
of
the
past
.
# sent_id = anot
The
night
was
old
and
the
East
grey
when
they
rode
up
at
last
from
Deeping-coomb	B-LOC
and
came
back
to
the
Hornburg	B-LOC
.
# sent_id = anot
He
used
to
tell
me
tales
like
that
,
knowing
how
I
was
always
one
for
hearing
about
Elves
.
# sent_id = anot
I
think
that
the
enemy
brought
his
own
enemy
with
him
,
answered
Aragorn	B-PER
.
# sent_id = anot
For
here
the
heirs
of
Valandil	B-PER
have
ever
dwelt
in
long
line
unbroken
from
father
unto
son
for
many
generations
.
# sent_id = anot
Even
when
the
paddles
were
in
use
they
did
not
trust
Sam	B-PER
with
one
.
# sent_id = anot
Good
evening
,
little
master
!
# sent_id = anot
he
said
,
bending
down
.
# sent_id = anot
Then
once
more
,
orc
fashion
,
he
leapt
aside
,
and
as
Sam	B-PER
sprang
at
him
,
using
the
heavy
bundle
as
both
shield
and
weapon
,
he
thrust
it
hard
into
his
enemy's
face
.
# sent_id = anot
Yet
you
speak
the
truth
,
that
is
plain
:
the
Men	B-ORG
of	I-ORG
the	I-ORG
Mark	I-ORG
do
not
lie
,
and
therefore
they
are
not
easily
deceived
.
# sent_id = anot
You
swore
a
promise
by
what
you
call
the
Precious
.
# sent_id = anot
On
the
third
morning
Caradhras	B-PER
rose
before
them
,
a
mighty
peak
,
tipped
with
snow
like
silver
,
but
with
sheer
naked
sides
,
dull
red
as
if
stained
with
blood
.
# sent_id = anot
They
had
no
fuel
nor
any
means
of
malting
torches
;
in
the
desperate
scramble
at
the
doors
many
things
had
been
left
behind
.
# sent_id = anot
But
the
day
has
brought
strange
tidings
.
# sent_id = anot
There
was
a
cold
gleam
in
it
.
# sent_id = anot
Your
leechcraft
ere
long
would
have
had
me
walking
on
all
fours
like
a
beast
.
# sent_id = anot
At
the
end
of
June
I
was
in
the
Shire	B-LOC
,
but
a
cloud
of
anxiety
was
on
my
mind
,
and
I
rode
to
the
southern
borders
of
the
little
land
;
for
I
had
a
foreboding
of
some
danger
,
still
hidden
from
me
but
drawing
near
.
# sent_id = anot
Elrond	B-PER
and
Arwen	B-PER
rose
and
went
down
the
hall
,
and
the
company
followed
them
in
due
order
.
# sent_id = anot
Travellers
scowl
at
us
,
and
countrymen
give
us
scornful
names
.
# sent_id = anot
Still
we
feel
less
ill
disposed
towards
Saruman	B-PER
than
we
did
.
# sent_id = anot
When
they
came
to
the
corner
they
looked
round
and
saw
that
the
path
ran
on
over
a
level
strip
under
the
face
of
a
low
cliff
overhung
with
trees
.
# sent_id = anot
Anyway
,
this
is
what
happened
.
# sent_id = anot
Who
comes
hither
to
disturb
the
rest
of
Balin	B-PER
Lord
of
Moria
?
# sent_id = anot
he
cried
in
a
loud
voice
.
# sent_id = anot
But
say
to
Denethor	B-PER
that
even
if
Rohan	B-LOC
itself
felt
no
peril
,
still
we
would
come
to
his
aid
.
# sent_id = anot
Gandalf	B-PER
was
gazing
up
,
his
arms
out
and
downwards
,
stiff
,
his
hands
clenched
.
# sent_id = anot
At
first
they
could
see
nothing
.
# sent_id = anot
And
begging
yours
,
Sam	B-PER
Gamgee	I-PER
,
replied
Bilbo	B-PER
.
# sent_id = anot
I
don’t
know
how
to
say
it
,
but
after
last
night
I
feel
different
.
# sent_id = anot
I
do
not
know
,
’
Strider	B-PER
answered
.
# sent_id = anot
Frodo	B-PER
waited
patiently
for
a
while
,
then
he
spoke
again
less
sternly
.
# sent_id = anot
The
sun
was
not
,
however
,
high
enough
yet
to
shine
down
into
the
clearing
,
though
its
light
was
on
the
tree
tops
.
# sent_id = anot
I
could
not
make
out
what
they
were
about
.
# sent_id = anot
I
hardly
feel
that
I
have
moved
at
all
.
# sent_id = anot
He
has
long
studied
it
,
seeking
the
lost
secrets
of
their
making
;
but
when
the
Rings
were
debated
in
the
Council	B-ORG
,
all
that
he
would
reveal
to
us
of
his
ring
lore
told
against
my
fears
.
# sent_id = anot
Take
courage
and
look
!
# sent_id = anot
There
are
fell
things
below
.
# sent_id = anot
He
knows
or
guesses
something
about
it
.
# sent_id = anot
The
biter
bit
,
the
hawk
under
the
eagle's
foot
,
the
spider
in
a
steel
web
!
# sent_id = anot
How
long
,
I
wonder
,
has
he
been
constrained
to
come
often
to
his
glass
for
inspection
and
instruction
,
and
the
Orthanc
stone
so
bent
towards
Baraddr B-LOC
that
,
if
any
save
a
will
of
adamant
now
looks
into
it
,
it
will
bear
his
mind
and
sight
swiftly
thither
?
# sent_id = anot
And
how
it
draws
one
to
itself
!
# sent_id = anot
Have
I
not
felt
it
?
# sent_id = anot
Even
now
my
heart
desires
to
test
my
will
upon
it
,
to
see
if
I
could
not
wrench
it
from
him
and
turn
it
where
I
would
to
look
across
the
wide
seas
of
water
and
of
time
to
Tirion	B-LOC
the	B-LOC
Fair	B-LOC
,
and
perceive
the
unimaginable
hand
and
mind
of
Fëanor	B-PER
at
their
work
,
while
both
the
White
Tree
and
the
Golden
were
in
flower
!
# sent_id = anot
He
sighed
and
fell
silent
.
# sent_id = anot
You
shall
sit
beside
me
,
as
long
as
I
remain
in
my
own
lands
,
and
lighten
my
heart
with
tales

# sent_id = anot
It's
a
long
time
,
Mr.
Frodo	B-PER
,
since
I
had
a
proper
sleep
,
and
my
eyes
just
closed
down
on
their
own
.
# sent_id = anot
They
came
at
last
to
a
white
bridge
,
and
crossing
found
the
great
gates
of
the
city

they
faced
south
west

shouted

danced
round
him

Now
Denethor	B-PER
stood
up
and
released
the
fevered
hand
of
Faramir	B-PER
that
he
had
held

Find

lasting

striding
up

bent
her
writhing

backwards

convulsive
leap

The

turned

At
last
one
evening
they
came
over
the
high
moors
,
suddenly
as
to
travellers
it
always
seemed
,
to
the
brink
of
the
deep
valley
of
Rivendell	B-LOC
and
saw
far
below
the
lamps
shining
in
Elrond's	B-PER
house
.
# sent_id = anot
A
part
of
his
tale
was
known
to
some
there
,
but
the
full
tale
to
none
,
and
many
eyes
were
turned't
Elrond	B-PER
in
fear
and
wonder
as
he
told
of
the
Elven
smiths
of
Eregion	B-LOC
and
their
friendship
with
Moria	B-LOC
,
and
their
eagerness
for
knowledge
,
by
which
Sauron	B-PER
ensnared
them
.
# sent_id = anot
The
old
man
took
no
notice
,
but
stooped
and
sat
himself
on
a
low
flat
stone

# sent_id = anot
There
is
a
wholesome
air
about
Hollin	B-PER
.
# sent_id = anot
He
thought
as
little
as
possible
about
the
Ring
,
and
where
it
might
lead
him
in
the
end
.
# sent_id = anot
The
world
is
indeed
full
of
peril
,
and
in
it
there
are
many
dark
places
;
but
still
there
is
much
that
is
fair
,
and
though
in
all
lands
love
is
now
mingled
with
grief
,
it
grows
perhaps
the
greater
.
# sent_id = anot
That
is
where
my

lives

Frodo	B-PER
stopped
eating
to
look
at
him

# sent_id = anot
Pippin	B-PER
stepped
back
hastily

# sent_id = anot
We
were
the
hunters

you

give
an
account

can
fill

They
came
to
a
cleft
between
two
dark
crags
,
and
passing
through
found
themselves
on
the
very
edge
of
the
last
fence

He
drove
his
paddle
into
the
water
,
trying
to
hold
the
boat
and
bring
it
round
.
# sent_id = anot
But
still
we
fight
on
,
holding
all
the
west
shores
of
Anduin	B-LOC
;
and
those
who
shelter
behind
us
give
us
praise
,
if
ever
they
hear
our
name
:
much
praise
but
little
help
.
# sent_id = anot
We
cannot
count
on
getting
anything
to
eat
between
here
and
Rivendell	B-LOC
,
except
what
we
take
with
us
;

we
ought
to
take
plenty
to

be
delayed

go
round

There
was
a
great
draught
of
warmer
air
behind
them

before
them
the
darkness
was
cold
on
their
faces

She
seemed
to
be
looking
inside
me

asking
me
what
I
would
do

gave
me
the
chance

flying
back
home
to
the
Shire	B-LOC
to
a

And
where

off
to

lands

Mr.
Gollum	B-PER

# sent_id = anot
he
growled

# sent_id = anot
If
he
comes
off
alive

he
should
be
your
faithful
servant

unhappy

# sent_id = anot
At
the
top
,
as
high
as
Gandalf	B-PER
could
reach

was
an
arch
of
interlacing
letters

an
Elvish
character

At
the
top
of
the
bank
the
horse
halted

turned

fiercely

Behind

walked
Legolas

Gimli

# sent_id = anot
Already
the
short
afternoon
was
past

a
dim
cloudy
dusk
was
closing
in

The

go
with

as
free
companions

to
help
him
on
his
way

Though
other

ask

I

He
was
running
on

singing

We
have
no
choice

to
go
on

or
to
return
to
Rivendell	B-LOC

# sent_id = anot
But
long
ago
he
rode
away
,
and
where
he
dwelleth
none
can
say
;
for
into
darkness
fell
his
star
in
Mordor	B-LOC
where
the
shadows
are

They
lived
mostly
in
Staddle	B-LOC

higher
slopes

above

I
should
very
much
like
just
to
peep

again

was
the

Your
talk

# sent_id = anot
Yes
,
sir

# sent_id = anot
said
Sam	B-PER
.
# sent_id = anot
For
it
has
no
virtue
that
we
know
of

save
perhaps
to
sweeten
a
fouled
air
,
or
to
drive
away
some
passing
heaviness

# sent_id = anot
No

poor
old
Gandalf	B-PER

But
it
could
not

And
rising
he
looked
then
on
Eowyn	B-PER
and
was
amazed
.
# sent_id = anot
But
Tom	B-PER
now
seemed
wide
awake

plied
them
with
questions

# sent_id = anot
Wicked

Tricksy

False

spat

stretched
out
his
long
arms

white
snapping
fingers

# sent_id = anot
They
had
words
with
Harry	B-PER
at
West
gate
on
Monday
.
# sent_id = anot
It
must
have
seemed
very
hasty
to
Treebeard	B-PER
,
for
Gandalf	B-PER
was
in
a
tremendous
hurry
,
and
was
already
talking
at
a
great
pace
,
before
they
passed
out
of
hearing

# sent_id = anot
Following
the
winding
way
up
the
green
shoulders
of
the
hills
,
they
came
at
last
to
the
wide
wind
swept
walls

the
gates

Edoras	B-loc

# sent_id = anot
In
the
middle
there
was
a
wood
fire
blazing

upon
the
tree
pillars
torches
with
lights

burning
steadily

You
do

your

At
the
top
was
a
wide
echoing
passage

# sent_id = anot
And
you
are
the
heir
of
Bilbo	B-PER

the
Ring
finder

They
sounded
disquietingly
like
signals
of
some
sort
;
but
after
a
while
the
knocking
died
away

was
not
heard
again

# sent_id = anot
Even
the
wise
cannot
see
all
ends

When
they
reached
the
bottom
it
was
so
chill
that
they
halted
and
got
out
cloaks
and
hoods
,
which
soon
became
bedewed
with
grey
drops
.
# sent_id = anot
Did
you
ask
about
the
sniffing
?
# sent_id = anot
We
didn't
discuss
it

Frodo	B-PER

his
mouth
full

They
were
going
fast

with
a
light
_clippety
clippely
clip

said
something
about
going
for

breath

Mind
that

you
need
ask

Elrond	B-PER

# sent_id = anot
Wait
for
me

Sam	B-PER

he
stammered
.
# sent_id = anot
Yet
the
way
of
the
Ring
to
my
heart
is
by
pity
,
pity
for
weakness
and
the
desire

strength
to
do
good

not

hobbits
sat
down
gladly

seated
chairs

Goldberry	B-PER
busied
herself
about

quiet

small

?
# sent_id = anot
asked
Sam
,
as
they
sat
,
stiff
and
chilled
,
munching
wafers
of
_lembas_
,
in
the
cold
grey
of
early
morning
.
# sent_id = anot
I
have
done
my
best
.
# sent_id = anot
And
if
you
make
so
much
noise
,
you
ll
wake
the
Chief's
Big
Man
.
# sent_id = anot
What's
made
you
change
your
mind
about
climbing
?
# sent_id = anot
I
haven't
changed
my
mind
.
# sent_id = anot
He
fell
and
came
heavily
on
his
hands
,
which
sank
deep
into
sticky
ooze
,
so
that
his
face
was
brought
close
to
the
surface
of
the
dark
mere
.
# sent_id = anot
The
other
three
went
on
.
# sent_id = anot
Upon
the
battlement
nothing
could
be
seen
.
# sent_id = anot
There
are
the
emblems
of
Durin	B-PER
!
# sent_id = anot
cried
Gimli	B-PER
.
# sent_id = anot
The
moon
as
it
rose
seemed
to
hang
for
a
moment
above
his
head
and
glistened
in
his
white
hair
as
the
wind
stirred
it
.
# sent_id = anot
But
we
have
suffered
much
loss
in
our
battles
with
Saruman	B-PER
the
traitor
,
and
we
must
still
think
of
our
frontier
to
the
north
and
east
,
as
his
own
tidings
make
clear
.
# sent_id = anot
’
Where
did
you
learn
such
tales
,
if
all
the
land
is
empty
and
forgetful
?
# sent_id = anot
’
asked
Peregrin	B-PER
.
# sent_id = anot
They
were
steering
,
as
well
as
they
could
guess
,
for
the
gate
like
opening
at
the
far
northward
end
of
the
long
valley
which
they
had
seen
in
the
morning
.
# sent_id = anot
Day
is
drawing
to
an
end
,
yet
Gandalf	B-PER
says
you
must
go
ere
nightfall
,
and
the
Lord
of
the
Mark
is
eager
for
his
own
house
.
# sent_id = anot
I
hope
so
,
said
Strider	B-PER
.
# sent_id = anot
You
told
us
that
you
had
once
passed
through
the
Mines
.
# sent_id = anot
I
must
be
trotting
.
# sent_id = anot
Some
thing
scared
Mr.
Frodo	B-PER
badly
.
# sent_id = anot
With
his
last
failing
senses
Frodo	B-PER
heard
cries
,
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
saw
,
beyond
the
Riders
that
hesitated
on
the
shore
,
a
shining
figure
of
white
light
;
and
behind
it
ran
small
shadowy
forms
waving
flames
,
that
flared
red
in
the
grey
mist
that
was
falling
over
the
world
.
# sent_id = anot
Here's
the
Gate
,
and
it
looks
to
me
as
if
that's
about
as
far
as
we
are
ever
going
to
get
.
# sent_id = anot
Gandalf	B-PER
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
span
,
leaning
on
the
staff
in
his
left
hand
,
but
in
his
other
hand
Glamdring
gleamed
,
cold
and
white
.
# sent_id = anot
Maybe
you
re
right
,
said
Frodo	B-PER
,
avoiding
the
farmer's
eye
and
staring
at
the
fire
.
# sent_id = anot
Yes
,
the
Ring
,
said
Merry	B-PER
.
# sent_id = anot
Bless
you
,
Gimli	B-PER
,
son
of
Gloin	B-PER
!
# sent_id = anot
Maybe
you
will
see
us
both
together
one
day
and
judge
between
us
!
# sent_id = anot
But
the
hobbits
!
# sent_id = anot
Legolas	B-PER
broke
in
.
# sent_id = anot
They
halted
suddenly
on
the
edge
,
and
peered
through
the
tree
trunks
,
holding
their
breath
.
# sent_id = anot
Well
,
that
was
years
ago
.
# sent_id = anot
All
that
is
said
among
us
is
that
far
away
,
over
many
hills
and
rivers
,
live
the
halfling
folk
that
dwell
in
holes
in
sand
dunes
.
# sent_id = anot
They
had
not
seen
the
Lord
and
Lady
again
,
and
they
had
little
speech
with
the
Elven
folk
;
for
few
of
these
knew
or
would
use
the
Westron
tongue
.
# sent_id = anot
Had
you
this
thing
in
keeping
?
# sent_id = anot
It
is
hidden
,
you
say
;
but
is
not
that
because
you
choose
to
hide
it
?
# sent_id = anot
No
,
not
because
I
choose
,
answered
Frodo	B-PER
.
# sent_id = anot
They
were
taken
by
surprise
.
# sent_id = anot
A
golden
afternoon
of
late
sunshine
lay
warm
and
drowsy
upon
the
hidden
land
between
.
# sent_id = anot
From
Lamedon	B-LOC
,
a
few
grim
hillmen
without
a
captain
.
# sent_id = anot
All
know
in
Gondor	B-LOC
that
he
went
first
to
Minas	B-LOC
Anor	I-LOC
and
dwelt
a
while
with
his
nephew
Meneldil	B-PER
,
instructing
him
,
before
he
committed
to
him
the
rule
of
the
South	B-LOC
Kingdom	I-LOC
.
# sent_id = anot
A
good
day
for
strolling
on
their
way
along
the
groves
and
glades
of
Ithilien	B-LOC
;
but
though
Orcs
may
shun
the
sunlight
.
# sent_id = anot
Pippin	B-PER
sat
miserably
by
the
door
in
the
pitch
dark
;
but
he
kept
on
turning
round
,
fearing
that
some
unknown
thing
would
crawl
up
out
of
the
well
.
# sent_id = anot
There
were
piles
of
refuse
everywhere
.
# sent_id = anot
Ho
la
!
# sent_id = anot
You
up
there
,
you
dunghill
rat
!
# sent_id = anot
Stop
your
squeaking
,
or
I
ll
come
and
deal
with
you
.
# sent_id = anot
Twitching
aside
his
grey
cloak
,
Pippin	B-PER
drew
forth
his
small
sword
and
laid
it
at
Denethor's	B-PER
feet
.
# sent_id = anot
As
they
went
forward
the
hills
about
them
steadily
rose
.
# sent_id = anot
Then
,
Eowyn	B-PER
of
Rohan	B-LOC
,
I
say
to
you
that
you
are
beautiful
.
# sent_id = anot
An
eastward
bend
led
them
hard
by
the
sward
of
Mirrormere	B-LOC
,
and
there
not
far
from
the
roadside
stood
a
single
column
broken
at
the
top
.
# sent_id = anot
We
must
be
off
,
he
said
.
# sent_id = anot
See
,
my
precious
:
if
we
has
it
,
then
we
can
escape
,
even
from
Him
,
eh
?
# sent_id = anot
Perhaps
we
grows
very
strong
,
stronger
than
Wraiths
.
# sent_id = anot
It
was
moving
fast
then
,
muttered
Aragorn	B-PER
,
and
not
with
the
wind
.
# sent_id = anot
If
you
mean
the
old
bogey
stories
Fatty's	B-PER
nurses
used
to
tell
him
,
about
goblins
and
wolves
and
things
of
that
sort
,
I
should
say
no
.
# sent_id = anot
And
I
will
begin
that
tale
,
though
others
shall
end
it
.
# sent_id = anot
Yet
that
would
have
to
be
done
that
very
night
,
before
they
all
went
to
bed
.
# sent_id = anot
You
cannot
cross
the
rivers
again
,
and
behind
you
there
are
now
secret
sentinels
that
you
cannot
pass
.
# sent_id = anot
There
you
are
,
Frodo	B-PER
!
# sent_id = anot
said
Merry	B-PER
.
# sent_id = anot
Yet
in
the
wizard's
face
he
saw
at
first
only
lines
of
care
and
sorrow
;
though
as
he
looked
more
intently
he
perceived
that
under
all
there
was
a
great
joy
:
a
fountain
of
mirth
enough
to
set
a
kingdom
laughing
,
were
it
to
gush
forth
.
# sent_id = anot
Yet
not
no
hope
.
# sent_id = anot
I
can't
stay
here
,
he
said
wildly
.
# sent_id = anot
Never
did
I
make
a
greater
mistake
!
# sent_id = anot
However
,
I
wrote
a
message
to
Frodo	B-PER
,
and
trusted
to
my
friend
the
innkeeper
to
send
it
to
him
.
# sent_id = anot
At
the
same
moment
they
became
aware
that
the
hedges
on
both
sides
,
just
above
their
heads
,
were
all
lined
with
hobbits
.
# sent_id = anot
Many
of
his
own
favourite
things
or
Bilbo's	B-PER
things
(
they
reminded
him
sharply
of
him
in
their
new
selling
)
were
arranged
as
nearly
as
possible
as
they
had
been
at
Bag	B-LOC
End	I-LOC
.
# sent_id = anot
It
cannot
be
doubted
that
we
witness
the
meeting
of
dear
friends
,
said
Theoden	B-PER
.
# sent_id = anot
Ai
oi
!
# sent_id = anot
he
shouted
.
# sent_id = anot
Nob	B-PER
trotted
off
with
a
grin
and
a
wink
.
# sent_id = anot
He
was
altogether
wretched
.
# sent_id = anot
Suddenly
Faramir	B-PER
stirred
,
and
he
opened
his
eyes
,
and
he
looked
on
Aragorn	B-PER
who
bent
over
him
;
and
a
light
of
knowledge
and
love
was
kindled
in
his
eyes
,
and
he
spoke
softly
.
# sent_id = anot
Gandalf	B-PER
snuffed
the
air
and
looked
back
.
# sent_id = anot
And
seen
closer
in
the
light
of
two
candles
that
he
lit
and
carried
before
them
the
landlord's
face
looked
rather
wrinkled
and
careworn
.
# sent_id = anot
It
began
last
night
at
sunset
.
# sent_id = anot
And
we
ll
save
the
Precious
,
as
we
promised
.
# sent_id = anot
’
He
wished
them
good
night
,
and
they
said
no
more
;
but
Frodo	B-PER
could
see
in
the
lantern
light
that
the
man
was
still
eyeing
them
curiously
.
# sent_id = anot
This
is
Sting
,
’
he
said
,
and
thrust
it
with
little
effort
deep
into
a
wooden
beam
.
# sent_id = anot
The
landlord
introduced
the
newcomers
to
the
Bree	B-LOC
folk
,
so
quickly
that
,
though
they
caught
many
names
,
they
were
seldom
sure
who
the
names
belonged
to
.
# sent_id = anot
Hey
!
# sent_id = anot
Come
derry
dol
!
# sent_id = anot
Hop
along
,
my
hearties
!
# sent_id = anot
Hobbits
!
# sent_id = anot
Ponies
all
!
# sent_id = anot
We
are
fond
of
parties
.
# sent_id = anot
We've
got
to
make
a
dash
for
it
!
# sent_id = anot
All
right
,
Sam	B-PER
,
said
Frodo	B-PER
.
# sent_id = anot
But
it
would
be
politer
in
any
case
for
the
challenger
to
say
who
he
is
.
# sent_id = anot
Into
what
deadly
perils
he
had
gone
alone
I
dared
not
guess
.
# sent_id = anot
Then
we
formed
our
conspiracy
;
and
as
we
were
serious
,
too
,
and
meant
business
,
we
have
not
been
too
scrupulous
.
# sent_id = anot
For
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
set
out
only
just
in
time
,
if
indeed
you
are
in
time
.
# sent_id = anot
Therefore
I
went
first
to
meet
him
and
hear
his
tale
.
# sent_id = anot
What
does
he
want
for
it
?
# sent_id = anot
Bill	B-PER
Ferny's	I-PER
price
was
twelve
silver
pennies
;
and
that
was
indeed
at
least
three
times
the
pony's
value
in
those
pans
.
# sent_id = anot
Or
is
it
one
of
your
imitations
?
# sent_id = anot
It
does
not
sound
altogether
encouraging
.
# sent_id = anot
It
was
green
and
stagnant
,
thrust
out
like
a
slimy
arm
towards
the
enclos
ing
hills
.
# sent_id = anot
Legolas	B-PER
and
I
wish
for
a
closer
view
.
# sent_id = anot
Strider	B-PER
had
drawn
the
curtains
and
pushed
back
the
shutters
with
a
clang
.
# sent_id = anot
Pale
waters
lapped
about
its
feet
.
# sent_id = anot
Ride
on
!
# sent_id = anot
Ride
on
!
# sent_id = anot
cried
Glorfindel	B-PER
,
and
then
loud
and
clear
he
called
to
the
horse
in
the
elf
tongue
:
_noro
lim
,
noro
lim
,
Asfaloth
!
# sent_id = anot
_
At
once
the
white
horse
sprang
away
and
sped
like
the
wind
along
the
last
lap
of
the
Road
.
# sent_id = anot
Well
,
I
see
you
have
ideas
of
your
own
,
’
he
said
.
# sent_id = anot
And
I
have
spent
most
of
the
years
since
then
in
finding
out
the
truth
of
it
.
# sent_id = anot
And
we
d
better
be
a
bit
more
watchful
ourselves
,
or
we
ll
feel
some
nasty
fingers
round
our
necks
one
of
these
nights
,
if
we
ever
wake
up
to
feel
anything
.
# sent_id = anot
O
nice
hobbits
!
# sent_id = anot
Smeagol	B-PER
brings
them
up
secret
ways
that
nobody
else
could
find
.
# sent_id = anot
And
are
not
the
bridges
of
Osgiliath	B-LOC
broken
down
and
all
the
landings
held
now
by
the
Enemy
?
# sent_id = anot
On
which
side
will
you
journey
?
# sent_id = anot
The
way
to
Minas	B-LOC
Tirith	I-LOC
lies
upon
this
side
,
upon
the
west
;
but
the
straight
road
of
the
Quest
lies
east
of
the
River
,
upon
the
darker
shore
.
# sent_id = anot
You
can't
be
thinking
of
doing
that
.
# sent_id = anot
Frodo	B-PER
wandered
round
the
familiar
rooms
,
and
saw
the
light
of
the
sunset
fade
on
the
walls
,
and
shadows
creep
out
of
the
corners
.
# sent_id = anot
But
Shelob	B-PER
was
not
as
dragons
are
,
no
softer
spot
had
she
save
only
her
eyes
.
# sent_id = anot
Tell
me
of
these
havens
as
we
walk
.
# sent_id = anot
But
it
was
an
old
tradition
that
away
over
there
stood
the
Grey	B-LOC
Havens	I-LOC
,
from
which
at
times
elven
ships
set
sail
,
never
to
return
.
# sent_id = anot
Were
the
breath
of
the
West
Wind
to
take
a
body
visible
,
even
so
would
it
appear
,
said
Eomer	B-PER
,
as
the
great
horse
ran
up
,
until
he
stood
before
the
wizard
.
# sent_id = anot
Still
there's
seldom
less
than
a
score
round
the
Boss
,
as
they
names
him
.
# sent_id = anot
Here
under
the
shadow
of
the
hills
there
had
been
some
rain
.
# sent_id = anot
I
wish
to
help
you
.
# sent_id = anot
Come
!
# sent_id = anot
Do
as
you
promised

give
it
up

# sent_id = anot
Well

if
you
want
my

yourself

so

# sent_id = anot
cried
Bilbo	B-PER
.
# sent_id = anot
Well

have
a
care

# sent_id = anot

Boromir	B-PER

# sent_id = anot
These
things
the
Elves
of
Middle	B-LOC
earth	I-LOC
have
in
some
measure
gained
,
though
with
sorrow
.
# sent_id = anot
True
words
doubtless
;
yet
all
such
comfort
is
cold
.
# sent_id = anot
There
was
a
ring
and
clatter
as
the
Company	B-ORG
drew
their
swords
.
# sent_id = anot
It
is
dry
at
least
,
and
there
is
food
,
though
no
fire
.
# sent_id = anot
The
morning
was
now
far
advanced
.
# sent_id = anot
He
tarried
there
from
errantry
,
and
melodies
they
taught
to
him
,
and
sages
old
him
marvels
told
,
and
harps
of
gold
they
brought
to
him

Who
are
you
,
and
what
do
you
want
?
# sent_id = anot
I
am
called
Strider	B-PER

he
answered
:
and
though
he
may
have
forgotten
it
,
your
friend
promised
to
have
a
quiet
talk
with
me
.
# sent_id = anot
They
had
a
struggle
to
get
out
of
the
thicket

# sent_id = anot
He
looked
at
them
with
half
closed
eyes
.
# sent_id = anot
We
have
two
more
ropes
.
# sent_id = anot
We
were
just
wondering
where
it
would
be
safe
to
lie
and
get
some
sleep
,
when
the
most
amazing
thing
of
all
happened
.
# sent_id = anot
’
But
in
that
time
also
he
made
this
scroll
,
’
said
Gandalf	B-PER
;
and
that
is
not
remembered
in
Gondor	B-LOC
,
it
would
seem
.
# sent_id = anot
Why
had
his
master
let
him
sleep
on
out
of
turn
,
right
on
till
evening
?
# sent_id = anot
Haven't
you
had
no
sleep
,
Mr.
Frodo	B-PER

# sent_id = anot
he
said

# sent_id = anot
He
needs
rest
.
# sent_id = anot
All
along
it
for
many
leagues
east
of
the
Bridge
there
are
trees
growing
.
# sent_id = anot
We
will
sit
on
the
edge
of
ruin
and
talk

The
enemy
before
them
seemed
to
have
grown
rather
than
diminished

still
more
were
pressing
up
from
the

Too

The
path
went
on
again
from

and
turning
to

again
across

plunged
down
a

And
with
that
,
even
as
his
eyes
were
lifted
up
to
gloat
on
his
prize
,
he
stepped
too
far
,
toppled

wavered
for
a
moment
on
the
brink

then
with
a
shriek
he
fell
.
# sent_id = anot
That
cheered
them
greatly
;
for
it
was
good
to
see
a
sight
of
anything
beyond
the
wood’s
borders
,
though
they
did
not
mean
to
go
that
way
,
if
they
could
help
it
:
the
Barrow	B-LOC
downs	I-LOC
had
as
sinister
a
reputation
in
hobbit
legend
as
the
Forest
itself

# sent_id = anot
They
had
done
nearly
fourteen
miles
with
only
one
rest
at
noon

difficult

quick
;

better
,

to
see

Do
not
let
him
run
away
!
# sent_id = anot
said
Boromir	B-PER
.
# sent_id = anot
Beside
Glorfindel	B-PER
there
were
several
other
counsellors
of
Elrond’s	B-PER
household
,
of
whom
Erestor	B-PER
was
the
chief
;
and
with
him
was
Galdor	B-PER
,
an
Elf
from
the
Grey	B-LOC
Havens	I-LOC
who
had
come
on
an
errand
from
Cirdan	B-PER
the
Shipwright
.
# sent_id = anot
The
travellers
now
rode
with
more
speed
,
and
they
made
their
way
towards
the
Gap	B-LOC
of	I-LOC
Rohan	I-LOC
;
and
Aragorn	B-PER
took
leave
of
them
at
last
close
to
that
very
place
where
Pippin	B-PER
had
looked
into
the
Stone
of
Orthanc	B-LOC
.
# sent_id = anot
And
thereupon
the
middle
door
of
the
Black	B-LOC
Gate	I-LOC
was
thrown
open
with
a
great
clang
,
and
out
of
it
there
came
an
embassy
from
the
Dark	B-LOC
Tower	I-LOC
.
# sent_id = anot
Leastways
old
Bilbo	B-PER
was
cracked
,
and
Frodo’s	B-PER
cracking

# sent_id = anot

saw
a
dark
sky
,

battlements

he
said
.

on

said
Frodo	B-PER

# sent_id = anot
Is
it
not
a
law
in
the
City
that
those
who
wear
the
black
and
silver
must
stay
in
the
Citadel
,
unless
their
lord
gives
them
leave

# sent_id = anot
He

said
Pippin	B-PER

# sent_id = anot
And
I
don't
wish
to
enter
it
even
once

said
Pippin	B-PER
.
# sent_id = anot
It
depends
on
many
chances
.
# sent_id = anot
Gloom
settled
still
more
heavily
on
Pippin	B-PER
.
# sent_id = anot
He
felt
that
he
was
lying
in
a
soft
slimy
bog
,
and
springing
up
he
set
his
fool
on
the
corner
of
a
cold
hard
flagstone
.
# sent_id = anot
It
is
no
good
saying
any
more
.
# sent_id = anot
All
they
could
do
was
to
follow
the
fold
downwards
.
# sent_id = anot
Why
that
way
,
I
wonder
?
# sent_id = anot
He
turned
.
# sent_id = anot
But
if
you
ll
pardon
my
speaking
out
,
I
think
my
master
was
right

# sent_id = anot
Ever
the
horn
blasts
wound
on
among
the
hills

nearer
now

answered

blowing
fierce
and
free
.
# sent_id = anot
Well
,
’
the
farmer
continued
,
approaching
his
point
with
slow
relish
,
he
came
riding
on
a
big
black
horse
in
at
the
gate
,
which
happened
to
be
open
,
and
right
up
to
my
door
.
# sent_id = anot
All
that
he
could
remember
about
Rohan	B-LOC
was
that
Gandalf's	B-PER
horse
,
Shadowfax	B-PER
,
had
come
from
that
land
.
# sent_id = anot

# sent_id = anot
We

said
Boromir	B-PER

# sent_id = anot
I
think
,
nonetheless
,
that
we
no
longer
need
any
trail
to
tell
us
which
way
to
go
,
said
Gimli	B-PER
.
# sent_id = anot
Do
Elves
live
in
those
woods
?
# sent_id = anot
he
asked
.
# sent_id = anot
Stone
rings
grinned
out
of
the
ground
like
broken
teeth
in
the
moonlight
.
# sent_id = anot
Indeed
the
hobbits
felt
that
the
hair
on
their
heads
was
actually
standing
up
,
waving
and
curling
and
growing
.
# sent_id = anot
Must
get
up
,
yes
they
must
!
# sent_id = anot
he
said
.
# sent_id = anot
In
pairs
they
galloped
by
,
and
though
every
now
and
then
one
rose
in
his
stirrups
and
gazed
ahead
and
to
either
side
,
they
appeared
not
to
perceive
the
three
strangers
sitting
silently
and
watching
them
.
# sent_id = anot
But
he
came
too
late
,
for
once
,
and
the
battle
was
over
and
beyond
his
help
before
he
reached
these
parts
.
# sent_id = anot
If
there
are
hobbit
folk
in
these
pans
,
why
don't
we
look
for
some
that
would
be
willing
to
take
us
in
?
# sent_id = anot
It
would
be
more
homelike
.
# sent_id = anot
We
feared
that
Saruman	B-PER
was
brewing
some
new
devilry
for
us
.
# sent_id = anot
I
wonder
,
said
Strider	B-PER
,
looking
round
thoughtfully
.
# sent_id = anot
Still
,
he
said
,
standing
suddenly
up
and
sticking
out
his
chin
.
# sent_id = anot
All
that
day
the
Company	B-ORG
marched
on
,
until
they
felt
the
cool
evening
come
and
heard
the
early
night
wind
whispering
among
many
leaves
.
# sent_id = anot
’
Legolas	B-PER
stirred
in
his
boat
.
# sent_id = anot
Where
d
you
think
you
re
going
?
# sent_id = anot
said
one
,
the
largest
and
most
evil
looking
of
the
crew
.
# sent_id = anot
I
should
like
a
bit
of
information
as
well
as
danger
.
# sent_id = anot
Some
I
cannot
trust
,
and
those
I
can
trust
are
too
dear
to
me
:
poor
old
Sam	B-PER
,
and
Merry	B-PER
and
Pippin	B-PER
.
# sent_id = anot
He
sighed
.
# sent_id = anot
As
Frodo	B-PER
prepared
to
follow
him
,
he
laid
his
hand
upon
the
tree
beside
the
ladder
:
never
before
had
he
been
so
suddenly
and
so
keenly
aware
of
the
feel
and
texture
of
a
tree's
skin
and
of
the
life
within
it
.
# sent_id = anot
He
has
led
us
in
here
against
our
fears
,
but
he
will
lead
us
out
again
,
at
whatever
cost
to
himself
.
# sent_id = anot
But
now
Frodo	B-PER
often
met
strange
dwarves
of
far
countries
,
seeking
refuge
in
the
West
.
# sent_id = anot
There's
more
stored
in
your
head
than
you
let
on
about
.
# sent_id = anot
’
Yes
,
it
all
comes
back
to
me
now

said
Frodo	B-PER
:
the
tremen
dous
roaring
.
# sent_id = anot
I
will
not
do
this
deed
.
# sent_id = anot
There
was
nothing
to
be
seen
.
# sent_id = anot
He
knows
it
.
# sent_id = anot
Think
of
the
riddles
they
both
knew
,
for
one
thing
.
# sent_id = anot
Not
far
beyond
them
the
stream
becomes
clear
and
smooth
again
,
though
it
runs
swiftly
.
# sent_id = anot
And
then
they
lost
no
more
time
.
# sent_id = anot
A
strong
wind
from
the
West
was
now
driving
the
fumes
of
Mordor	B-LOC
from
the
upper
airs
.
# sent_id = anot
I
should
know
,
for
I
had
one
to
tend
in
the
Houses
.
# sent_id = anot
And
nothing
will
ever
be
all
right
where
that
piece
of
misery
is
.
# sent_id = anot
’
Dangerous
or
not
,
a
real

welcome

’
said
Frodo	B-PER
,
throwing
back
his
hood
and
letting
the
morning
light
fall
on
his
face
.
# sent_id = anot
It
seemed
different
so
far
away
,
in
the
Shire	B-LOC
or
in
Rivendell	B-LOC
.
# sent_id = anot
He
gazed
back
along
the
way
that
they
had
come
towards
the
night
gathering
in
the
East
.
# sent_id = anot
Black
Riders
would
have
to
ride
over
him
to
get
near
the
waggon
.
# sent_id = anot
At
last
lulled
by
the
wind
in
the
boughs
above
,
and
the
sweet
murmur
of
the
falls	B-LOC
of	I-LOC
Nimrodel	I-LOC
below
,
Frodo	B-PER
fell
asleep
with
the
song
of
Legolas	B-PER
running
in
his
mind
.
# sent_id = anot
Yes
,
to
Mordor	B-LOC
,
’
said
Gandalf	B-PER
.
# sent_id = anot
Beside
him
Merry	B-PER
lay
,
white
faced
,
with
a
dirty
rag
bound
across
his
brows
.
# sent_id = anot
But
Aragorn	B-PER
dismounted
,
and
standing
by
the
Stone
he
cried
in
a
great
voice
:
Oathbreakers
,
why
have
ye
come
?
# sent_id = anot
And
a
voice
was
heard
out
of
the
night
that
answered
him
,
as
if
from
far
away
:
To
fulfil
our
oath
and
have
peace
.
# sent_id = anot
Before
long
they
had
all
passed
and
vanished
.
# sent_id = anot
Soon
the
white
form
of
the
Lady
was
small
and
distant
.
# sent_id = anot
Do
you
advise
me
to
look
?
# sent_id = anot
asked
Frodo	B-PER
.
# sent_id = anot
Ah
!
# sent_id = anot
said
Aragorn	B-PER
.
# sent_id = anot
And
then
there
are
some
trees
in
the
valleys
under
the
mountains
,
sound
as
a
bell
,
and
bad
right
through
.
# sent_id = anot
The
rivers
long
defended
us
,
but
they
are
a
sure
guard
no
more
;
for
the
Shadow
has
crept
northward
all
about
us
.
# sent_id = anot
There
are
none
.
# sent_id = anot
In
their
dark
cloaks
they
were
as
invisible
as
if
they
all
had
magic
rings
.
# sent_id = anot
Aragorn	B-PER
strode
on
through
the
inner
court
,
and
mounted
to
a
high
chamber
in
the
tower
.
# sent_id = anot
Only
a
remnant
of
our
eastern
force
came
back
,
destroying
the
last
bridge
that
still
stood
amid
the
ruins	B-LOC
of	I-LOC
Osgiliath	I-LOC
.
# sent_id = anot
Speak
no
more
of
it
!
# sent_id = anot
But
so
it
is
,
Sam	B-PER
:
in
that
land
you
lost
your
count
.
# sent_id = anot
It
is
cold
in
the
tree
tops
in
winter
,
though
the
wind
tonight
is
in
the
South
;
but
we
have
food
and
drink
to
give
you
that
will
drive
away
the
night
chill
,
and
we
have
skins
and
cloaks
to
spare
.
# sent_id = anot
That’s
good
for
a
beginning
.
# sent_id = anot
He
looked
on
the
bright
point
of
the
sword
.
# sent_id = anot
They
roared
and
boomed
and
trumpeted
,
until
stones
began
to
crack
and
fall
at
the
mere
noise
of
them
.
# sent_id = anot
’
The
night
wind
blew
chill
up
the
valley
to
meet
them
.
# sent_id = anot
But
never
mind
.
# sent_id = anot
The
three
hobbits
came
on
,
and
then
the
ruffians
turned
and
fled
running
away
up
the
Hobbiton	B-LOC
Road	I-LOC
;
but
they
blew
their
horns
as
they
ran
.
# sent_id = anot
You
will
learn
that
your
trouble
is
but
part
of
the
trouble
of
all
the
western
world

# sent_id = anot
I
reckon
it
isn't
safe
for
us
both
to
sleep
together
,
and
begging
your
pardon
,
but
I
can't
hold
up
my
lids
much
longer
.
# sent_id = anot
So
I
stayed
there
that
night
,
wondering
much
what
had
become
of
the
Riders
;
for
only
of
two
had
there
yet
been
any
news
in
Bree	B-LOC

it
seemed

# sent_id = anot
Give
me
your
bow

# sent_id = anot
Great
trees
passed
by
like
ghosts
,
thrusting
their
twisted
thirsty
roots
through
the
mist
down
into
the
water

# sent_id = anot
But
now
the
world
is
changing
once
again

# sent_id = anot
The
dining
room
was
bare
except
for
a
table
and
chairs
,
but
the
food
was
good
,
and
there
was
good
wine
:
Frodo’s	B-PER
wine
had
not
been
included
in
the
sale
to
the
Sackville	B-PER
Bagginses	I-PER

# sent_id = anot
The
world
was
darkling

# sent_id = anot
The
others
slunk
away

# sent_id = anot
I
have
returned
from
the
Northern	B-LOC
Fences	I-LOC

# sent_id = anot
Why

not
be
any

riders
discover
that

are
not
Orcs

are
dead

# sent_id = anot
Sam	B-PER
looked
at
Frodo	B-PER

# sent_id = anot
Do
as
you
please
in
your
madness

but
let

first
get
down

Gandalf	B-PER

# sent_id = anot
But
I
can't
keep
awake
any
longer
.
# sent_id = anot
The
swords
flashed
from
the
sheath
as
one
.
# sent_id = anot
They
just
want
a
match
,
though
,
and
they
ll
go
up
in
fire
.
# sent_id = anot
I
need
a
change
,
or
something
.
# sent_id = anot
The
cut
is
not
poisoned
,
as
the
wounds
of
orc
blades
too
often
are
.
# sent_id = anot
My
heart
tells
me
that
Sauron	B-PER
will
expect
us
to
take
the
western
way
,
when
he
learns
what
has
befallen
.
# sent_id = anot
The
day
waned
,
and
dusk
was
twined
about
the
boles
of
the
trees
.
# sent_id = anot
Why
,
cousin
,
one
of
them
went
with
only
his
esquire
into
the
Black	B-LOC
Country	I-LOC
and
fought
with
the
Dark	B-PER
Lord	I-LORD
all
by
himself
,
and
set
fire
to
his
Tower
,
if
you
can
believe
it

# sent_id = anot
Those
who
no
longer
wish
to
go
forward
may
remain
here
,
for
a
while

# sent_id = anot
I’ll
say
you’re
dead

have
left
the

anything

like

# sent_id = anot

# sent_id = anot
I
knew
that
you
were
coming

but
I
was
at
work
up
the
valley

there
is
much
still
to
be
done

They
will
sing
that

other
songs

Blessed B-LOC

But
now
the
dark
swooping
shadows
were
aware
of
the
newcomer

# sent_id = anot
Then
he
remembered
where
he
was
and
lay
down
again

# sent_id = anot
Then
he
sat
in
the
largest
chair
and
called
the
hobbits
to
gather
round
him

It
rose
up
nearly
to

got

Then
I
heard
Bilbo's B-PER
strange
story
of
how
he
had
won
it
,
and
I
could
not
believe
it
.
# sent_id = anot
A
man
came
and
beckoned
to
the
hobbits
,
and
took
them
to
the
recess
at
the
back
of
the
cave
.
# sent_id = anot
Not
very

too

It
is
but
a
feint
,
said
Aragorn B-PER
;
and
its
chief
purpose
,
I
deem
,
was
rather
to
draw
us
on
by
a
false
guess
of
our
Enemyes
weakness
than
to
do
us
much
hurt
,
yet

# sent_id = anot
Help

he
cried

# sent_id = anot
Even
in
the
Shire   B-LOC
there
are
some
as
like
minding
other
folk

business
and
talking
big
.
# sent_id = anot
I
have
known
strong
warriors
of
the
Big
People

would
quickly
have
been
overcome
by
that
splinter

which
you
bore
for
seventeen

# sent_id = anot
So
!
# sent_id = anot
Well
,
here
we
are

all

said
Merry   B-PER

where
are
the

# sent_id = anot
It
was
after
nightfall
when
,
wet
and
tired
,
the
travellers
came
at
last
to
the
Brandywine  B-LOC

and
they
found
the

barred

# sent_id = anot
When
they
had
stood
silent
for
a
time
beside
the
king
,
Imrahil B-PER
said
:
Where
is
the
Steward B-PER

# sent_id = anot
You'd
have
to
get
Strider B-PER

# sent_id = anot
But
Smeagol B-PER
doesn't
mind

# sent_id = anot
Yes

he
answered
.
# sent_id = anot
And
dimly
to
be
seen
were
many
rows
of
tables

carved
of

upon

bent
sharply
west

the

beneath

lay
the

# sent_id = anot
Slowly
the

Merry   B-PER

climbed

fled

When
they
came
to
the
arch
Gandalf B-PER
went
through

signing
to
them
to
wait

# sent_id = anot
He
was
taking
a
far
greater
risk
than
he
knew

but
Frodo   B-PER
was
too
much
occupied
with
his
burden
and
with
the
struggle
in
his
mind
to
debate
,
and
almost
too
hopeless
to
care
.
# sent_id = anot
They
ate
a
very
frugal
supper
(
for
hobbits
)
,
and
then
went
on
again
.
# sent_id = anot
I
wish
then
to
learn
from
you
more
of
it

for
what
concerns

# sent_id = anot
All

Here

she

They
called

began
to

# sent_id = anot
But
where

Of
what
they
brought
to

the

gathered

all

The

the

the

Will

said
Gandalf B-PER
.
# sent_id = anot
And
that
may
well
befall
,
said
Gimli   B-PER
.
# sent_id = anot
’
Whether
because
of
Strider’s   B-PER
skill
or
for
some
other
reason
,
they
saw
no
sign
and
heard
no
sound
of
any
other
living
thing
all
that
day
:
neither
two
footed
,
except
birds
;
nor
four
footed
,
except
one
fox
and
a
few
squirrels
.
# sent_id = anot
Not
to
evil
,
I
think
.
# sent_id = anot
But
there
is
much
to
read
in
that
book
,
and
I
cannot
claim
to
have
seen
more
than
a
page
or
two
.
# sent_id = anot
Frodo   B-PER
actually
laughed
.
# sent_id = anot
The
other
hobbits
agreed
hopefully
that
it
did
not
,
but
they
all
remained
full
of
suspicion
.
# sent_id = anot

# sent_id = anot
Excellent

# sent_id = anot
The
stair
was
dark
,
but
on
the
roof
top
the
glare
of
the
Mountain
could
still
be
seen
,
though
it
was
dying
down
now
to
a
sullen

# sent_id = anot
We
are
coming
to
reaches
of
the
River
that
I
do
not
know
well
:
for
I
have
never
journeyed
by
water
in
these
parts
before
,
not
between
here
and
the
rapids
of
Sarn    B-LOC

# sent_id = anot
That
would
not
be
easy
,
even
if
we
were
all
Men
,
said
Boromir B-PER
.
# sent_id = anot
So
the
Company
went
on
their
long
way
,
down
the
wide
hurrying
waters
,
borne
ever
southwards
.
# sent_id = anot
I
ll
look
in
again
later

# sent_id = anot
Then
the
watch
upon
the
walls
of
Mordor  B-LOC
slept
,
and
dark
things
crept
back
to

Pippin  B-PER
declared
that
Frodo   B-PER
was
looking
twice
the
hobbit

he
had
been

# sent_id = anot
But
you
won

send
him
off
alone
surely

# sent_id = anot
But
not
the

Pippin  B-PER

# sent_id = anot
Orc

Sam B-PER
,
waving
his

# sent_id = anot
I
will
shorten
the
stirrups
up
to
the
saddle
skins
,
and
you
must
sit
as
tight
as
you
can

# sent_id = anot
I
wonder
what
became
of
it
.
# sent_id = anot
How
long
have
you
known
this
?
# sent_id = anot
I
cannot
answer
that
now
,
said
Gandalf B-PER
.
# sent_id = anot
Just
as
nice
a
little
stair
for
that
slinking
Gollum  B-PER

we
could
leave

Merry   B-PER

was
roused
by
Legolas B-PER

# sent_id = anot
Come

Mr.
Frodo   B-PER
,
said
Sam
.
# sent_id = anot
said
the
Elf
in
a
hissing
whisper
,
and
cast
on
to
the
flet
the
rope
ladder
rolled
up
.
# sent_id = anot
I
wish
it
had
never

never

been

# sent_id = anot
Wandering
aimlessly
at
first
in
the
wood
,
Frodo   B-PER
found
that
his
feet
were
leading
him
up
towards
the
slopes
of
the
hill
.
# sent_id = anot
There
were
some
that
shook
their
heads
and
thought
this
was
too
much
of
a
good
thing
;
it
seemed
unfair
that
anyone
should
possess
(
apparently
)
perpetual
youth
as
well
as
(
reputedly
)
inexhaustible
wealth
.
# sent_id = anot
A
little
way
off
he
heard
a
harsh
laugh
and
the
tread
of
many
feet
on
the
ground
below
.
# sent_id = anot
Wolf
!
# sent_id = anot
It
is
close
to
the
Road
.
# sent_id = anot
said
Gandalf B-PER
,
shaking
his
head
.
# sent_id = anot
But
soon
Pippin  B-PER
saw
that
all
was
in
fact
well
ordered
:
the
wains
were
moving
in
three
lines
,
one
swifter
drawn
by
horses
;
another
slower
,
great
waggons
with
fair
housings
of
many
colours
,
drawn
by
oxen
;
and
along
the
west
rim
of
the
road
many
smaller
carts
hauled
by
trudging
men
.
# sent_id = anot
Yet
,
Master
Peregrin    B-PER
,
we
have
this
honour
:
ever
we
bear
the
brunt
of
the
chief
hatred
of
the
Dark    B-PER
Lord    I-PER
,
for
that
hatred
comes
down
out
of
the
depths
of
time
and
over
the
deeps
of
the
Sea
.
# sent_id = anot
A
score
or
more
.
# sent_id = anot
Yet
that
was
now
a
day
ago
.
# sent_id = anot
s
had
passed
,
and
was
looking
straight
at
Bilbo   B-PER
when
he
suddenly
reappeared
.
# sent_id = anot
In
that
clear
air
watchmen
on
the
walls
saw
afar
a
new
sight
of
fear
,
and
their
last
hope
left
them
.
# sent_id = anot
said
Gimli   B-PER
.
# sent_id = anot
It
is
rather
a
strange
and
sad
story
,
he
went
on
after
a
pause
.
# sent_id = anot
Great
beasts
drew
it
,
Orcs
surrounded
it
,
and
behind
walked
mountain
trolls
to
wield
it
.
# sent_id = anot
Often
blocked
or
destroyed
by
the
tumults
of
the
Mountain
s
furnaces
,
always
that
road
was
repaired
and
cleaned
again
by
the
labours
of
countless
orcs
.
# sent_id = anot
You
were
very
fond
of
Bilbo   B-PER
were
you
not
?
# sent_id = anot
’
Sam B-PER
muttered
something
inaudible
.
# sent_id = anot
It
will
go
behind
the
hills
soon
,
yess
.
# sent_id = anot
But
you
d
best
ask
Barliman    B-PER
.
# sent_id = anot
He
told
me
that
his
business
with
you
had
gone
well
,
and
that
you
would
be
starting
for
Rivendell   B-LOC
in
the
last
week
of
September
.
# sent_id = anot
I
wonder
what
he
will
say
?
# sent_id = anot
Is
that
so
?
# sent_id = anot
Before
them
the
mountains
frowned
,
but
their
path
lay
in
a
deep
trough
of
land
and
they
could
see
only
the
higher
shoulders
and
the
far
eastward
peaks
.
# sent_id = anot
Many
of
the
trees
seemed
asleep
,
or
as
unaware
of
him
as
of
any
other
creature
that
merely
passed
by
;
but
some
quivered
,
and
some
raised
up
their
branches
above
his
head
as
he
approached
.
# sent_id = anot
He
sheathed
his
sword
.
# sent_id = anot
It
will
be
quicker
so
.
# sent_id = anot
And
I
hope
he
s
up
to
no
tricks
.
# sent_id = anot
Now
I
see
your
mind
.
# sent_id = anot
Gimli   B-PER
started
and
then
stood
still
as
stone
,
staring
,
while
the
old
man
sprang
up
the
rough
steps
as
nimbly
as
a
goat
.
# sent_id = anot
But
I
don’t
think
you
need
go
alone
.
# sent_id = anot
Sleepy
heads
,
yes
,
sleepy
heads
!
# sent_id = anot
In
a
little
while
they
came
to
the
point
on
the
East
Road
where
they
had
taken
leave
of
Bombadil    B-PER
;
and
they
hoped
and
half
expected
to
see
him
standing
there
to
greet
them
as
they
went
by
.
# sent_id = anot
Well
,
I
have
rather
a
rascally
look
,
have
I
not
?
# sent_id = anot
I
was
not
sure
of
it
myself
when
I
was
last
here
;
but
the
time
has
come
to
speak
.
# sent_id = anot
Steep
as
a
stair
,
it
looped
backwards
and
forwards
as
it
climbed
.
# sent_id = anot
What
of
the
Three
Rings
of
the
Elves
?
# sent_id = anot
I
used
to
think
that
they
were
things
the
wonderful
folk
of
the
stories
went
out
and
looked
for
,
because
they
wanted
them
,
because
they
were
exciting
and
life
was
a
bit
dull
,
a
kind
of
a
sport
,
as
you
might
say
.
# sent_id = anot
There
he
stood
,
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
and
the
wind
in
his
hair
,
and
looked
down
upon
the
three
hobbits
,
that
had
been
laid
on
their
backs
upon
the
grass
at
the
west
side
of
the
mound
.
# sent_id = anot
Whether
because
of
some
special
keenness
of
sight
,
or
because
of
some
other
sense
,
the
horse
lifted
and
sprang
lightly
over
them
;
but
its
rider
did
not
see
them
,
lying
covered
in
their
elven
cloaks
,
too
crushed
for
the
moment
,
and
too
afraid
to
move
.
# sent_id = anot
I
will
sleep
now
,
’
he
said
;
and
the
Elf
led
him
to
a
bower
beside
Pippin  B-PER
,
and
he
threw
himself
upon
a
bed
and
fell
at
once
into
a
dreamless
slumber
.
# sent_id = anot
At
that
Bilbo   B-PER
opened
an
eye
,
almost
as
if
he
had
heard
.
# sent_id = anot
Must
get
up
,
yes
they
must
!
# sent_id = anot
It
won
t
sound
too
pretty
to
say
you
ve
caught
the
kitten
and
let
the
cat
escape
.
# sent_id = anot
He
soon
found
that
the
thicket
was
closer
and
more
tangled
than
it
had
appeared
.
# sent_id = anot
Later
that
day
the
hobbits
held
a
meeting
of
their
own
in
Bilbo’s B-PER
room
.
# sent_id = anot
The
Sackville   B-PER
Bagginses   I-PER
were
rather
offensive
.
# sent_id = anot
The
morning
is
wearing
away
.
# sent_id = anot
Then
swift
as
a
runner
over
firm
sand
he
shot
away
,
and
quickly
overtaking
the
toiling
men
,
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
he
passed
them
,
and
sped
into
the
distance
,
and
vanished
round
the
rocky
turn
.
# sent_id = anot
Even
reckoned
as
a
lord
and
captain
Saruman B-PER
has
grown
very
strong
.
# sent_id = anot
The
land
had
changed
.
# sent_id = anot
Yet
,
maybe
,
he
would
not
have
done
so
,
and
the
journey
of
Boromir B-PER
was
doomed
.
# sent_id = anot
Frodo   B-PER
,
Mr.
Frodo   B-PER
!
# sent_id = anot
Suddenly
Frodo   B-PER
laughed
:
from
the
covered
basket
he
held
,
the
scent
of
mushrooms
was
rising
.
# sent_id = anot
But
few
marked
what
Isildur B-PER
did
.
# sent_id = anot
Then
he
let
sound
a
great
concourse
of
trumpets
taken
from
the
enemy
;
and
the
Shadow
Host
withdrew
to
the
shore
.
# sent_id = anot
And
the
Dwarf
,
hearing
the
names
given
in
his
own
ancient
tongue
,
looked
up
and
met
her
eyes

and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
looked
suddenly
into
the
heart
of
an
enemy
and
saw
there
love
and
understanding
.
# sent_id = anot
Not
far
down
the
bank
Strider B-PER
pointed
out
a
stone
in
the
grass

Twice

For
Radagast    B-PER
knew
no
reason
why
he
should
not
do
as
I
asked
;
and
he
rode
away
towards
Mirkwood    B-LOC
where
he
had
many
friends
of
old
.
# sent_id = anot
In
those
days
the
Companions
of
the
Ring
dwelt
together
in
a
fair
house
with
Gandalf B-PER
,
and
they
went
to
and
fro
as
they
wished
.
# sent_id = anot
I
am
Mr.
Underhill   B-PER
,
if
any
name
must
be
given
.
# sent_id = anot
And
why
should
he
want
such
slaves
?
# sent_id = anot
Man
!
# sent_id = anot
Dangerous
,
and
probably
useless
;
but
it
must
be
done
.
# sent_id = anot
’
And
to
Frodo   B-PER
she
said
:
Farewell
,
Elf
friend
,
it
was
a
merry
meeting
!
# sent_id = anot
Not
much

# sent_id = anot
I
came
to
Buckland    B-LOC
and
found
it
in
uproar
,
as
busy
as
a
hive
of
ants
that
has
been
stirred
with
a
stick
.
# sent_id = anot
There
were
the
prints
of
orc
feet
in
the
earth
.
# sent_id = anot
Then
the
Nine    B-PER
Riders  I-PER
issued
forth
from
the
gates
of
horror
,
and
we
could
not
withstand
them
.
# sent_id = anot
spilled
and
fed
the
falling
stream
.
# sent_id = anot
A
great
cloud
of
it
was
going
up
far
away
in
the
direction
of
the
Woody   B-LOC
End I-LOC
.
# sent_id = anot
They
had
ridden
for
some
five
hours
and
were
far
out
upon
the
western
plain
,
yet
more
than
half
their
journey
lay
still
before
them
.
# sent_id = anot
Before
he
could
conceal
it
,
they
saw
through
the
mask
the
anguish
of
a
mind
in
doubt
,
loathing
to
stay
and
dreading
to
leave
its
refuge
.
# sent_id = anot
I
do
not
know
for
what
reason
the
Enemy
is
pursuing
you
,
answered
Gildor  B-PER
;
but
I
perceive
that
he
is
strange
indeed
though
that
seems
to
me
.
# sent_id = anot
Got
you

Gorbag  B-PER

# sent_id = anot
These
Rings

The
morning
was
now
far
advanced

# sent_id = anot
he
said
.
# sent_id = anot
Your
small
fire
,
of
course
,
would
not
melt
even
ordinary
gold

# sent_id = anot
It
is
a
sad
necessity
.
# sent_id = anot
He
stepped
back
shaking
all
over
and
looked
at
the
Lady
.
# sent_id = anot
If
only
they
are
in
a
hurry
and
will
let
a
couple
of
tired
soldiers
alone
and
pass
on
!
# sent_id = anot
May
the
curse
of
Faramir B-PER
bite
that
Gollum  B-PER
and
bite
him
quick
!
# sent_id = anot
Many
fives
of
his
small
kind
.
# sent_id = anot
Now
answer
me
:
whither
would
you
go
?
# sent_id = anot
A
new
hour
comes
.
# sent_id = anot
Would
any
of
you
have
believed

# sent_id = anot
They
saw
nothing
more
,
until
they
stumbled
over
the
body
of
Frodo   B-PER
,
lying
as
if
dead
,
face
downwards
on
the
grass
with
his
sword
beneath
him
.
# sent_id = anot
At
his
side
Pippin  B-PER
lay
dreaming
pleasantly
;
but
a
change
came
over
his
dreams
and
he
turned
and
groaned
.
# sent_id = anot

# sent_id = anot
Rowan   B-PER

grew
about

But
I’m
beginning
to
think
it’s
time
we
got
a
sight
of
that
Fiery   B-LOC
Mountain    I-LOC
,
and
saw
the
end
of
the
Road
,
so
to
speak
.
# sent_id = anot
I
have
no
memory
of
this
place
at
all

# sent_id = anot
’
said
Glorfindel  B-PER
to
them
,
pouring
for
each
in
turn
a
little
liquor
from
his
silver
studded
flask
of
leather
.
# sent_id = anot
Sam B-PER
!
# sent_id = anot
What
is
it
all
about
?
# sent_id = anot
How
far
is
there
to
go
?
# sent_id = anot
The
boats
were
all
huddled
together
.
# sent_id = anot
Surely
the
time
is
up
?
# sent_id = anot
They
are
made
of
the
fair
tree
lebethron
,
beloved
of
the
woodwrights
of
Gondor  B-LOC
,
and
a
virtue
has
been
set
upon
them
of
finding
and
returning
.
# sent_id = anot
Why
yes
!
# sent_id = anot
All
the
same
,
I
am
not
sure
that
Treebeard   B-PER
is
right
:
I
fancy
he
could
do
some
mischief
still
in
a
small
mean
way
.
# sent_id = anot
Gandalf B-PER
sat
down
again
and
puffed
at
his
pipe
,
as
if
lost
in
thought
.
# sent_id = anot
Then
they
all
fell
silent
,
and
one
by
one
the
hobbits
dropped
off
to
sleep
.
# sent_id = anot
So
it
was
that
Frodo   B-PER
saw
her
whom
few
mortals
had
yet
seen
;
Arwen
,
daughter
of
Elrond  B-PER
,
in
whom
it
was
said
that
the
likeness
of
Luthien B-PER
had
come
on
earth
again
;
and
she
was
called
Undomiel    B-PER
,
for
she
was
the
Evenstar
of
her
people
.
# sent_id = anot
Out
flew
a
red
golden
dragon
not
life
size
,
but
terribly
life
like
:
fire
came
from
his
jaws
,
his
eyes
glared
down
;
there
was
a
roar
,
and
he
whizzed
three
times
over
the
heads
of
the
crowd
.
# sent_id = anot
We
don't
often
see
Shire   B-LOC
folk
riding
on
the
Road
at
night
,
he
went
on
,
as
they
halted
a
moment
by
his
door
.
# sent_id = anot
It
was
early
April
and
the
sky
was
now
clearing
after
heavy
rain
.
# sent_id = anot
At
that
moment
the
rider
sat
up
,
and
shook
the
reins
.
# sent_id = anot
In
what
far
time
and
place
did
he
come
into
the
world
,
and
when
would
he
leave
it
?
# sent_id = anot
Here
the
Company
decided
to
stay
and
await
the
dawn
:
it
was
useless
to
attempt
to
move
further
by
night
.
# sent_id = anot
For
a
while
out
of
politeness
the
hobbits
visited
the
Common
Room
in
the
evening
and
answered
a
good
many
questions
.
# sent_id = anot
No
man
will
touch
them
I
promise
you
,
he
said
.
# sent_id = anot
I
think
I
could
probably
make
some
arrangements
by
then
.
# sent_id = anot
In
a
twinkling
the
table
was
laid
.
# sent_id = anot
Smeagol B-PER
was
holding
a
debate
with
some
other
thought
that
used
the
same
voice
but
made
it
squeak
and
hiss
.
# sent_id = anot
Leg
it
!
# sent_id = anot
Well
,
here
is
the
strangest
riddle
that
we
have
yet
found
!
# sent_id = anot
Must
bathe
feet
a
minute
.
# sent_id = anot
That
was
a
regrettable
misunderstanding
,
long
set
right
.
# sent_id = anot
It
is
but
a
trifle
that
Sauron  B-PER
fancies
,
and
an
earnest
of
your
good
will
.
# sent_id = anot
Well
earned
?
# sent_id = anot
Frodo   B-PER
sat
for
a
while
and
shivered
,
dreadful
fears
chasing
one
another
through
his
mind
.
# sent_id = anot
No
,
said
Gandalf B-PER
.
# sent_id = anot
So
wise
they
are
;
so
just
,
so
very
just
.
# sent_id = anot
he
shouted
as
he
leaped
down
the
stair
from
the
Rock
with
many
men
of
Westfold    B-LOC
at
his
back
.
# sent_id = anot
Pippin  B-PER
and
Sam B-PER
strapped
up
their
three
packs
and
piled
them
in
the
porch
.
# sent_id = anot
No
,
not
at
the
rear
!
# sent_id = anot
It
does
,
said
Frodo   B-PER
.
# sent_id = anot
The
other
halted
,
and
his
voice
was
full
of
fear
and
rage
.
# sent_id = anot
So
he
will
!
# sent_id = anot
Darkness
came
early
to
the
silent
woods
,
and
before
the
fall
of
night
they
halted
,
weary
,
for
they
had
walked
seven
leagues
or
more
from
Henneth B-LOC
Annun   I-LOC
.
# sent_id = anot
Some
suddenly
loomed
up
right
in
front
of
him
.
# sent_id = anot
Before
long
,
washed
and
refreshed
,
the
hobbits
were
seated
at
the
table
,
two
on
each
side
,
while
at
either
end
sat
Gold    B-PER
berry   I-PER
and
the
Master
.
# sent_id = anot
Come
,
Smeagol B-PER
!
# sent_id = anot
He
is
a
valiant
man
.
# sent_id = anot
Clang
.
# sent_id = anot
They
came
swiftly
from
the
North
,
walking
like
wading
herons
in
their
gait
,
but
not
in
their
speed
;
for
their
legs
in
their
long
paces
beat
quicker
than
the
heron
s
wings
.
# sent_id = anot
He
told
us
not
to
risk
getting
entangled
in
it
.
# sent_id = anot
A
black
shadow
seemed
to
pass
like
an
arm
above
him
;
it
missed
Amon    B-LOC
Hen I-LOC
and
groped
out
west
,
and
faded
.
# sent_id = anot
Why
did
it
come
to
me
?
# sent_id = anot
I
think
one
of
his
spies
would
well
,
seem
fairer
and
feel
fouler
,
if
you
understand
.
# sent_id = anot
In
days
to
come
,
if
my
Elven
lord
allows
,
some
of
our
folk
shall
remove
hither
;
and
when
we
come
it
shall
be
blessed
,
for
a
while

# sent_id = anot
I
want

So
do
I

said
Gandalf B-PER

# sent_id = anot
Come
on
now

master

sing
us
something
that
we
haven’t
heard
before

# sent_id = anot
Then
he
shut
and
locked
the
door
.
# sent_id = anot
The
landlord
jumped
with
surprise
.
# sent_id = anot
The
trail
led
them
north
along
the
top
of
the
escarpment
,
and
at
length
they
came
to
a
deep
cleft
carved
in
the
rock
by
a
stream
that
splashed
noisily
down
.
# sent_id = anot
When
they
had
finished
they
stood
up
.
# sent_id = anot
They
stared
at
him
in
alarm
for
a
moment
before
he
gasped
:
I
have
seen
them
,
Frodo   B-PER
!
# sent_id = anot
It
is
not
a
very
broad
belt
I
should
have
said
no
more
than
a
mile
at
the
widest
and
we
ought
to
have
been
through
it
by
now

# sent_id = anot
Frodo
went
in
once
,
long
ago

# sent_id = anot
Behind
that
there
was
something
else
at
work
,
beyond
any
design
of
the
Ring
maker
.
# sent_id = anot
You
are
not
alone
.
# sent_id = anot
What
will
become
of
him
?
# sent_id = anot

I
do
indeed
,
’
answered
Strider B-PER
.
# sent_id = anot
’
Well
yes
and
no
.
# sent_id = anot
I
thought
we
should
be
off
today

# sent_id = anot
Be
wary
still

# sent_id = anot
Ride
now

ride

# sent_id = anot
My
heart
would
be
glad
if
I
were
beneath
the
eaves
of
that
wood

and
it
were
springtime

# sent_id = anot
So
they
called
him
Gollum  B-PER
,
and
cursed
him
,
and
told
him
to
go
far
away
;
and
his
grandmother
,
desiring
peace
,
expelled
him
from
the
family
and
turned
him
out
of
her
hole

said
Frodo   B-PER

# sent_id = anot
He
is
his
own
master

# sent_id = anot
No

not
altogether
wicked

said
Frodo
.
# sent_id = anot
It
would
possess
him

# sent_id = anot
They
spoke
of
many
things

old

and
Frodo   B-PER
ques
tioned
Gildor  B-PER
much
about
happenings
in
the
wide

# sent_id = anot
Now
the
time
was
anxious
,
and
the
host
was
in
peril

# sent_id = anot
He
must
have
put
the
Ring
on

came

why
do

he
was
gone

Some
were
brightly
painted

and
shone
with
silver
and
gold
and
green
,
but
most
were
either
white
or
grey

# sent_id = anot
He
was
interested
,
however

to
hear
that
Dain    B-PER
was
still
King
under
the
Mountain

and
was
now
old
(
having
passed
his
two
hundred

fiftieth
year

venerable

fabulously
rich

# sent_id = anot
But
if
you
ask

Elrond  B-PER
will
send
out
a

do

foretell

sit

But
just
as
he
thought

his
dinner
was
caught

He
found
his
hands
had
hold

now
from

came
answering
cries

seated

is
waiting
!
# sent_id = anot
I
was
told
to
find
you
before
Midsummer
,
and
that
is
now
here
.
# sent_id = anot
Might
I
ask
your
names
,
sirs
?
# sent_id = anot
I
guess
that
he
was
attacked
on
this
hill
top
,
but
with
what
result
I
cannot
tell
.
# sent_id = anot
And
with
that
he
lifted
high
his
sword
and
flames
ran
down
the
blade
.
# sent_id = anot
The
hobbits
wandered
here
and
there
visiting
again
the
places
that
they
had
passed
before
;
and
Sam B-PER
hoped
always
in
some
shadow
of
the
woods
or
secret
glade
to
catch
,
maybe
,
a
glimpse
of
the
great
Oliphaunt
.
# sent_id = anot
It
was
a
path
made
by
strong
arms
and
heavy
feet
.
# sent_id = anot
No
,
I
can
t
give
no
message
.
# sent_id = anot
Boats
may
make
your
journey
less
toilsome
for
a
while
.
# sent_id = anot
Just
this
,
my
dear
old
Frodo   B-PER
:
you
are
miserable
,
because
you
don’t
know
how
to
say
good
bye
.
# sent_id = anot
His
upturned
hornlike
tusks
were
bound
with
bands
of
gold
and
dripped
with
blood
.
# sent_id = anot
The
travellers
passed
within
,
and
the
gates
shut
behind
them
.
# sent_id = anot
Small
bands
of
weary
and
often
wounded
men
came
first
with
little
order
;
some
were
running
wildly
as
if
pursued
.
# sent_id = anot
What
other
fairer
way
would
you
desire
?
# sent_id = anot
chuckled
Merry   B-PER
as
he
rolled
himself
in
his
blanket
.
# sent_id = anot
Time
is
pressing
,
said
the
Rider   B-PER
,
not
heeding
Aragorn B-PER
.
# sent_id = anot
Yes
,
I
think
that
would
be
so
.
# sent_id = anot
He
shuddered
and
said
no
more
,
leaving
Merry   B-PER
to
tell
of
those
last
horrible
moments
:
the
pawing
hands
,
the
hot
breath
,
and
the
dreadful
strength
of
Grishnakh's B-PER
hairy
arms
.
# sent_id = anot
All
the
top
of
your
hill
is
full
of
tunnels
packed
with
chests
of
gold
and
silver
,
and
jools
,
by
what
I’ve
heard
.
# sent_id = anot
And
yet
again
Ents
are
more
like
Men
,
more
changeable
than
Elves
are
,
and
quicker
at
taking
the
colour
of
the
outside
,
you
might
say
.
# sent_id = anot
No
,
said
Merry   B-PER
.
# sent_id = anot
As
the
dark
drew
on
I
knew
that
haste
was
needed
,
so
I
rode
thence
with
three
others
that
could
also
be
horsed
.
# sent_id = anot
Even
the
Elves
do
likewise
at
need
,
and
blindfolded
we
crossed
the
borders
of
fair
Lothlorien  B-LOC
.
# sent_id = anot
The
Riders
were
too
swift
to
overtake
,
and
too
many
to
oppose
.
# sent_id = anot
I
fancy
now
that
she
could
do
some
wonderful
things
,
if
she
had
a
mind
.
# sent_id = anot
It
has
passed
on
.
# sent_id = anot
As
the
stars
above
the
mists
of
the
Northern
lands
was
her
loveliness
,
and
in
her
face
was
a
shining
light
.
# sent_id = anot
They
rode
down
the
bank
and
looked
up
and
down
.
# sent_id = anot
Dotard
!
# sent_id = anot
Worst
is
a
bad
word
,
I
said
to
him
,
and
I
hope
you
do
not
live
to
see
it
.
# sent_id = anot
The
Sackville   B-PER
Bagginses   I-PER
scowled
,
and
wondered
what
was
meant
by
coming
into
his
inheritance’
.
# sent_id = anot
The
terrors
of
the
land
beyond
,
and
the
deed
to
be
done
there
,
seemed
remote
,
too
far
off
yet
to
trouble
him
.
# sent_id = anot
Frodo   B-PER
was
the
wisest
person
in
the
world
(
with
the
possible
exception
of
Old
Mr.
Bilbo   B-PER
and
of
Gandalf B-PER
)
.
# sent_id = anot
I
was
not
sent
to
beg
any
boon
,
but
to
seek
only
the
meaning
of
a
riddle
,
answered
Boromir B-PER
proudly
.
# sent_id = anot
You
are
kindly
hosts
!
# sent_id = anot
Leave
your
barrow
empty
!
# sent_id = anot
The
Lord
drives
his
son
too
hard
,
and
now
he
must
do
the
duty
of
two
,
for
himself
and
for
the
one
that
will
not
return
.
# sent_id = anot
The
late
afternoon
was
bright
and
peaceful
.
# sent_id = anot
I
do
not
know
.
# sent_id = anot
he
cried
.
# sent_id = anot
I
never
really
expected
to
find
any
pipe
weed
on
the
journey
,
when
my
own
ran
out
.
# sent_id = anot
Hullo
,
Sam B-PER
!
# sent_id = anot
At
that
moment
some
dozen
Orcs
that
had
lain
motionless
among
the
slain
leaped
to
their
feet
,
and
came
silently
and
swiftly
behind
.
# sent_id = anot
But
we
call
it
lembas
or
waybread
,
and
it
is
more
strengthening
than
any
food
made
by
Men
,
and
it
is
more
pleasant
than
cram
,
by
all
accounts
.
# sent_id = anot
He
did
not
speak
so
that
I
could
hear
words
.
# sent_id = anot
It
could
be
beaten
like
copper
,
and
polished
like
glass
;
and
the
Dwarves
could
make
of
it
a
metal
,
light
and
yet
harder
than
tempered
steel
.
# sent_id = anot
That
night
they
camped
on
a
stony
shelf
with
a
rock
wall
behind
them
,
in
which
there
was
a
shallow
cave
,
a
mere
scoop
in
the
cliff
.
# sent_id = anot
Black
drops
dripped
from
the
blade
and
smoked
on
the
floor
.
# sent_id = anot
Maybe
thou
shalt
find
Valimar B-LOC
.
# sent_id = anot
That
much
I
perceived
clearly
in
his
mind
.
# sent_id = anot
They
did
not
talk
,
but
kept
glancing
back
,
and
from
side
to
side
.
# sent_id = anot
’
We
can
cut
straighter
than
the
road
anyway
,
’
answered
Frodo   B-PER
.
# sent_id = anot
You
ll
see
,
Mr.
Frodo   B-PER
.
# sent_id = anot
Go
after
those
two
young
hobbits
,
and
guard
them
at
the
least
,
even
if
you
cannot
find
Frodo   B-PER
.
# sent_id = anot
He
was
very
quiet
to
begin
with
,
but
his
fame
began
to
grow
.
# sent_id = anot
Aye
,
you
do
indeed
,
said
Gimli   B-PER
,
looking
them
up
and
down
over
the
top
of
his
cup
.
# sent_id = anot
It
is
no
good
trying
to
escape
you
.
# sent_id = anot
Beneath
the
stars
of
Ever
eve
in
Eldamar B-LOC
it
shone
,
In
Eldamar B-LOC
beside
the
walls
of
Elven
Tirion  B-LOC
.
# sent_id = anot
It
was
answered
;
and
to
the
dismay
of
Frodo   B-PER
and
his
friends
out
from
the
trees
and
rocks
away
on
the
left
four
other
Riders  B-ORG
came
flying
.
# sent_id = anot
Frodo   B-PER
came
in
soon
afterwards
,
and
found
him
sitting
in
the
dark
,
deep
in
thought
.
# sent_id = anot
Away
in
the
distance
eastward
they
could
now
see
a
line
of
hills
.
# sent_id = anot
Same
one
,
I
reckon
.
# sent_id = anot
There's
a
tidy
bit
of
money
tucked
away
up
there
,
I
hear
tell
,
said
a
stranger
,
a
visitor
on
business
from
Michel  B-LOC
Delving I-LOC
in
the
Westfarthing    B-LOC
