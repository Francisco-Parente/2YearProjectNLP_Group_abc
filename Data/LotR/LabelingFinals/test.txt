I
want
to
see
the
wild
country
again
before
I
die
,
and
the
Mountains
;
but
he
is
still
in
love
with
the
Shire	B-LOC
,
with
woods
and
fields
and
little
rivers
.
The
forest
began
to
draw
nearer
.
Of
Numenor	B-LOC
he
spoke
,
its
glory
and
its
fall
,
and
the
return
of
the
Kings
of
Men
to
Middle	B-LOC
earth	I-LOC
out
of
the
deeps
of
the
Sea
,
borne
upon
the
wings
of
storm
.
There
they
stood
,
stooping
in
a
circle
round
the
little
dancing
and
blowing
flames
.
Maybe
there
is
some
that
want
to
know
what
has
become
of
the
gold
and
jewels
that
he
buried
in
the
hill
of
Hobbiton	B-LOC
,
as
I
hear
?
’
Frodo	B-PER
said
nothing
:
the
shrewd
guesses
of
the
farmer
were
rather
disconcerting
.
And
he
took
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
under
the
sunlit
sky
,
and
he
cared
not
that
they
stood
high
upon
the
walls
in
the
sight
of
many
.
Sounds
too
easy
at
any
rate
in
the
telling
.
But
the
Ring
was
lost
.
Right
across
the
floor
,
close
to
the
feet
of
two
huge
pillars
a
great
fissure
had
opened
.
Very
lucky
you
came
this
way
.
It
is
time
to
get
up
.
And
I
don't
remember
any
moon
,
either
new
or
old
,
in
Caras	B-LOC
Galadhon	I-LOC
:
only
stars
by
night
and
sun
by
day
.
A
star
came
out
above
the
trees
in
the
darkening
East
before
them
.
No
one
had
a
more
attentive
audience
than
old
Flam	B-PER
Gamgee	I-PER
,
commonly
known
as
the
Gaffer	B-PER
.
They
have
been
summoned
,
said
Elladan	B-PER
.
He
is
here
no
longer
,
and
we
must
now
look
after
ourselves
and
make
our
own
way
to
Rivendell	B-LOC
,
as
best
we
can
.
Loose
us
!
Loose
us
!
he
said
.
It
is
my
burden
,
and
no
one
else
can
bear
it
.
It
was
also
clear
that
Tom	B-PER
had
dealings
with
the
Elves
,
and
it
seemed
that
in
some
fashion
,
news
had
reached
him
from
Gildor	B-LOC
concerning
the
flight
of
Frodo	B-PER
.
There
are
loose
slabs
that
may
tilt
up
and
throw
you
down
into
a
pit
,
if
you
don't
take
care
.
Come
!
said
Aragorn	B-PER
.
In
the
days
of
fair
weather
we
led
Gollum	B-PER
through
the
woods
;
and
there
was
a
high
tree
standing
alone
far
from
the
others
which
he
liked
to
climb
.
Not
yet
.
They
are
all
roused
now
,
and
their
mind
is
all
on
one
thing
:
breaking
Isengard	B-LOC
.
The
mountains
were
veiled
in
deepening
dusk
,
and
the
wind
was
cold
.
Silly
old
fool
.
If
you
would
understand
them
better
,
then
I
bid
you
come
with
me
,
said
Aragorn	B-PER
;
for
that
way
I
now
shall
take
.
We
will
go
together
.
Aragorn	B-PER
halted
and
examined
the
tracks
closely
.
Men
now
hurried
out
to
them
from
the
City
;
and
soon
they
all
passed
from
sight
under
the
outer
walls
,
and
he
knew
that
they
were
entering
the
Gate
.
The
sickle
Moon
was
gleaming
dimly
among
the
leaves
.
But
now
suddenly
his
errand
returned
to
his
memory
,
and
he
ran
forward
.
Not
without
Mr.
Frodo	B-PER
.
Then
let
us
start
as
soon
as
it
is
light
tomorrow
,
if
we
can
,
said
Boromir	B-PER
.
And
the
air
is
wholesome
there
because
of
the
outlets
through
fissures
in
the
rock
far
above
.
Did
you
see
them
again
,
Mr.
Frodo	B-PER
?
asked
Sam
,
as
they
sat
,
stiff
and
chilled
,
munching
wafers
of
_lembas_
,
in
the
cold
grey
of
early
morning
.
I
have
done
my
best
.
And
if
you
make
so
much
noise
,
you
ll
wake
the
Chief's
Big
Man
.
What's
made
you
change
your
mind
about
climbing
?
I
haven't
changed
my
mind
.
He
fell
and
came
heavily
on
his
hands
,
which
sank
deep
into
sticky
ooze
,
so
that
his
face
was
brought
close
to
the
surface
of
the
dark
mere
.
The
other
three
went
on
.
Upon
the
battlement
nothing
could
be
seen
.
There
are
the
emblems
of
Durin	B-PER
!
cried
Gimli	B-PER
.
The
moon
as
it
rose
seemed
to
hang
for
a
moment
above
his
head
and
glistened
in
his
white
hair
as
the
wind
stirred
it
.
But
we
have
suffered
much
loss
in
our
battles
with
Saruman	B-PER
the
traitor
,
and
we
must
still
think
of
our
frontier
to
the
north
and
east
,
as
his
own
tidings
make
clear
.
’
Where
did
you
learn
such
tales
,
if
all
the
land
is
empty
and
forgetful
?
’
asked
Peregrin	B-PER
.
They
were
steering
,
as
well
as
they
could
guess
,
for
the
gate
like
opening
at
the
far
northward
end
of
the
long
valley
which
they
had
seen
in
the
morning
.
Day
is
drawing
to
an
end
,
yet
Gandalf	B-PER
says
you
must
go
ere
nightfall
,
and
the
Lord
of
the
Mark
is
eager
for
his
own
house
.
I
hope
so
,
said
Strider	B-PER
.
You
told
us
that
you
had
once
passed
through
the
Mines
.
I
must
be
trotting
.
Some
thing
scared
Mr.
Frodo	B-PER
badly
.
With
his
last
failing
senses
Frodo	B-PER
heard
cries
,
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
saw
,
beyond
the
Riders
that
hesitated
on
the
shore
,
a
shining
figure
of
white
light
;
and
behind
it
ran
small
shadowy
forms
waving
flames
,
that
flared
red
in
the
grey
mist
that
was
falling
over
the
world
.
Here's
the
Gate
,
and
it
looks
to
me
as
if
that's
about
as
far
as
we
are
ever
going
to
get
.
Gandalf	B-PER
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
span
,
leaning
on
the
staff
in
his
left
hand
,
but
in
his
other
hand
Glamdring
gleamed
,
cold
and
white
.
Maybe
you
re
right
,
said
Frodo	B-PER
,
avoiding
the
farmer's
eye
and
staring
at
the
fire
.
Yes
,
the
Ring
,
said
Merry	B-PER
.
Bless
you
,
Gimli	B-PER
,
son
of
Gloin	B-PER
!
Maybe
you
will
see
us
both
together
one
day
and
judge
between
us
!
But
the
hobbits
!
Legolas	B-PER
broke
in
.
They
halted
suddenly
on
the
edge
,
and
peered
through
the
tree
trunks
,
holding
their
breath
.
Well
,
that
was
years
ago
.
All
that
is
said
among
us
is
that
far
away
,
over
many
hills
and
rivers
,
live
the
halfling
folk
that
dwell
in
holes
in
sand
dunes
.
They
had
not
seen
the
Lord
and
Lady
again
,
and
they
had
little
speech
with
the
Elven
folk
;
for
few
of
these
knew
or
would
use
the
Westron
tongue
.
Had
you
this
thing
in
keeping
?
It
is
hidden
,
you
say
;
but
is
not
that
because
you
choose
to
hide
it
?
No
,
not
because
I
choose
,
answered
Frodo	B-PER
.
They
were
taken
by
surprise
.
A
golden
afternoon
of
late
sunshine
lay
warm
and
drowsy
upon
the
hidden
land
between
.
From
Lamedon	B-LOC
,
a
few
grim
hillmen
without
a
captain
.
All
know
in
Gondor	B-LOC
that
he
went
first
to
Minas	B-LOC
Anor	I-LOC
and
dwelt
a
while
with
his
nephew
Meneldil	B-PER
,
instructing
him
,
before
he
committed
to
him
the
rule
of
the
South	B-LOC
Kingdom	I-LOC
.
A
good
day
for
strolling
on
their
way
along
the
groves
and
glades
of
Ithilien	B-LOC
;
but
though
Orcs
may
shun
the
sunlight
.
Pippin	B-PER
sat
miserably
by
the
door
in
the
pitch
dark
;
but
he
kept
on
turning
round
,
fearing
that
some
unknown
thing
would
crawl
up
out
of
the
well
.
There
were
piles
of
refuse
everywhere
.
Ho
la
!
You
up
there
,
you
dunghill
rat
!
Stop
your
squeaking
,
or
I
ll
come
and
deal
with
you
.
Twitching
aside
his
grey
cloak
,
Pippin	B-PER
drew
forth
his
small
sword
and
laid
it
at
Denethor's	B-PER
feet
.
As
they
went
forward
the
hills
about
them
steadily
rose
.
Then
,
Eowyn	B-PER
of
Rohan	B-LOC
,
I
say
to
you
that
you
are
beautiful
.
An
eastward
bend
led
them
hard
by
the
sward
of
Mirrormere	B-LOC
,
and
there
not
far
from
the
roadside
stood
a
single
column
broken
at
the
top
.
We
must
be
off
,
he
said
.
See
,
my
precious
:
if
we
has
it
,
then
we
can
escape
,
even
from
Him
,
eh
?
Perhaps
we
grows
very
strong
,
stronger
than
Wraiths
.
It
was
moving
fast
then
,
muttered
Aragorn	B-PER
,
and
not
with
the
wind
.
If
you
mean
the
old
bogey
stories
Fatty's	B-PER
nurses
used
to
tell
him
,
about
goblins
and
wolves
and
things
of
that
sort
,
I
should
say
no
.
And
I
will
begin
that
tale
,
though
others
shall
end
it
.
Yet
that
would
have
to
be
done
that
very
night
,
before
they
all
went
to
bed
.
You
cannot
cross
the
rivers
again
,
and
behind
you
there
are
now
secret
sentinels
that
you
cannot
pass
.
There
you
are
,
Frodo	B-PER
!
said
Merry	B-PER
.
Yet
in
the
wizard's
face
he
saw
at
first
only
lines
of
care
and
sorrow
;
though
as
he
looked
more
intently
he
perceived
that
under
all
there
was
a
great
joy
:
a
fountain
of
mirth
enough
to
set
a
kingdom
laughing
,
were
it
to
gush
forth
.
Yet
not
no
hope
.
I
can't
stay
here
,
he
said
wildly
.
Never
did
I
make
a
greater
mistake
!
However
,
I
wrote
a
message
to
Frodo	B-PER
,
and
trusted
to
my
friend
the
innkeeper
to
send
it
to
him
.
At
the
same
moment
they
became
aware
that
the
hedges
on
both
sides
,
just
above
their
heads
,
were
all
lined
with
hobbits
.
Many
of
his
own
favourite
things
or
Bilbo's	B-PER
things
(
they
reminded
him
sharply
of
him
in
their
new
selling
)
were
arranged
as
nearly
as
possible
as
they
had
been
at
Bag	B-LOC
End	I-LOC
.
It
cannot
be
doubted
that
we
witness
the
meeting
of
dear
friends
,
said
Theoden	B-PER
.
Ai
oi
!
he
shouted
.
Nob	B-PER
trotted
off
with
a
grin
and
a
wink
.
He
was
altogether
wretched
.
Suddenly
Faramir	B-PER
stirred
,
and
he
opened
his
eyes
,
and
he
looked
on
Aragorn	B-PER
who
bent
over
him
;
and
a
light
of
knowledge
and
love
was
kindled
in
his
eyes
,
and
he
spoke
softly
.
Gandalf	B-PER
snuffed
the
air
and
looked
back
.
And
seen
closer
in
the
light
of
two
candles
that
he
lit
and
carried
before
them
the
landlord's
face
looked
rather
wrinkled
and
careworn
.
It
began
last
night
at
sunset
.
And
we
ll
save
the
Precious
,
as
we
promised
.
’
He
wished
them
good
night
,
and
they
said
no
more
;
but
Frodo	B-PER
could
see
in
the
lantern
light
that
the
man
was
still
eyeing
them
curiously
.
This
is
Sting
,
’
he
said
,
and
thrust
it
with
little
effort
deep
into
a
wooden
beam
.
The
landlord
introduced
the
newcomers
to
the
Bree	B-LOC
folk
,
so
quickly
that
,
though
they
caught
many
names
,
they
were
seldom
sure
who
the
names
belonged
to
.
Hey
!
Come
derry
dol
!
Hop
along
,
my
hearties
!
Hobbits
!
Ponies
all
!
We
are
fond
of
parties
.
We've
got
to
make
a
dash
for
it
!
All
right
,
Sam	B-PER
,
said
Frodo	B-PER
.
But
it
would
be
politer
in
any
case
for
the
challenger
to
say
who
he
is
.
Into
what
deadly
perils
he
had
gone
alone
I
dared
not
guess
.
Then
we
formed
our
conspiracy
;
and
as
we
were
serious
,
too
,
and
meant
business
,
we
have
not
been
too
scrupulous
.
For
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
set
out
only
just
in
time
,
if
indeed
you
are
in
time
.
Therefore
I
went
first
to
meet
him
and
hear
his
tale
.
What
does
he
want
for
it
?
Bill	B-PER
Ferny's	I-PER
price
was
twelve
silver
pennies
;
and
that
was
indeed
at
least
three
times
the
pony's
value
in
those
pans
.
Or
is
it
one
of
your
imitations
?
It
does
not
sound
altogether
encouraging
.
It
was
green
and
stagnant
,
thrust
out
like
a
slimy
arm
towards
the
enclos
ing
hills
.
Legolas	B-PER
and
I
wish
for
a
closer
view
.
Strider	B-PER
had
drawn
the
curtains
and
pushed
back
the
shutters
with
a
clang
.
Pale
waters
lapped
about
its
feet
.
Ride
on
!
Ride
on
!
cried
Glorfindel	B-PER
,
and
then
loud
and
clear
he
called
to
the
horse
in
the
elf
tongue
:
_noro
lim
,
noro
lim
,
Asfaloth
!
_
At
once
the
white
horse
sprang
away
and
sped
like
the
wind
along
the
last
lap
of
the
Road
.
Well
,
I
see
you
have
ideas
of
your
own
,
’
he
said
.
And
I
have
spent
most
of
the
years
since
then
in
finding
out
the
truth
of
it
.
And
we
d
better
be
a
bit
more
watchful
ourselves
,
or
we
ll
feel
some
nasty
fingers
round
our
necks
one
of
these
nights
,
if
we
ever
wake
up
to
feel
anything
.
O
nice
hobbits
!
Smeagol	B-PER
brings
them
up
secret
ways
that
nobody
else
could
find
.
And
are
not
the
bridges
of
Osgiliath	B-LOC
broken
down
and
all
the
landings
held
now
by
the
Enemy
?
On
which
side
will
you
journey
?
The
way
to
Minas	B-LOC
Tirith	I-LOC
lies
upon
this
side
,
upon
the
west
;
but
the
straight
road
of
the
Quest
lies
east
of
the
River
,
upon
the
darker
shore
.
You
can't
be
thinking
of
doing
that
.
Frodo	B-PER
wandered
round
the
familiar
rooms
,
and
saw
the
light
of
the
sunset
fade
on
the
walls
,
and
shadows
creep
out
of
the
corners
.
But
Shelob	B-PER
was
not
as
dragons
are
,
no
softer
spot
had
she
save
only
her
eyes
.
Tell
me
of
these
havens
as
we
walk
.
But
it
was
an
old
tradition
that
away
over
there
stood
the
Grey	B-LOC
Havens	I-LOC
,
from
which
at
times
elven
ships
set
sail
,
never
to
return
.
Were
the
breath
of
the
West
Wind
to
take
a
body
visible
,
even
so
would
it
appear
,
said
Eomer	B-PER
,
as
the
great
horse
ran
up
,
until
he
stood
before
the
wizard
.
Still
there's
seldom
less
than
a
score
round
the
Boss
,
as
they
names
him
.
Here
under
the
shadow
of
the
hills
there
had
been
some
rain
.
I
wish
to
help
you
.
Come
!
Do
as
you
promised
:
give
it
up
!
Well
,
if
you
want
my
ring
yourself
,
say
so
!
cried
Bilbo	B-PER
.
Well
,
have
a
care
!
said
Boromir	B-PER
.
These
things
the
Elves
of
Middle	B-LOC
earth	I-LOC
have
in
some
measure
gained
,
though
with
sorrow
.
True
words
doubtless
;
yet
all
such
comfort
is
cold
.
There
was
a
ring
and
clatter
as
the
Company	B-ORG
drew
their
swords
.
It
is
dry
at
least
,
and
there
is
food
,
though
no
fire
.
The
morning
was
now
far
advanced
.
He
tarried
there
from
errantry
,
and
melodies
they
taught
to
him
,
and
sages
old
him
marvels
told
,
and
harps
of
gold
they
brought
to
him
.
Who
are
you
,
and
what
do
you
want
?
I
am
called
Strider	B-PER
,
he
answered
:
and
though
he
may
have
forgotten
it
,
your
friend
promised
to
have
a
quiet
talk
with
me
.
They
had
a
struggle
to
get
out
of
the
thicket
.
He
looked
at
them
with
half
closed
eyes
.
We
have
two
more
ropes
.
We
were
just
wondering
where
it
would
be
safe
to
lie
and
get
some
sleep
,
when
the
most
amazing
thing
of
all
happened
.
’
But
in
that
time
also
he
made
this
scroll
,
’
said
Gandalf	B-PER
;
and
that
is
not
remembered
in
Gondor	B-LOC
,
it
would
seem
.
Why
had
his
master
let
him
sleep
on
out
of
turn
,
right
on
till
evening
?
Haven't
you
had
no
sleep
,
Mr.
Frodo	B-PER
?
he
said
.
He
needs
rest
.
All
along
it
for
many
leagues
east
of
the
Bridge
there
are
trees
growing
.
We
will
sit
on
the
edge
of
ruin
and
talk
,
as
Gandalf	B-PER
says
,
while
he
is
busy
elsewhere
.
A
fierce
eager
will
was
there
.
The
enemy
before
them
seemed
to
have
grown
rather
than
diminished
,
still
more
were
pressing
up
from
the
valley
through
the
breach
.
’
Too
warm
,
I
shouldn’t
wonder
,
’
muttered
Sam	B-PER
to
Frodo	B-PER
.
It's
heavy
on
me
,
Sam
lad
,
very
heavy
.
Gilgalad	B-LOC
is
_Starlight_
in
their
tongue
.
The
path
went
on
again
from
the
door
,
and
turning
to
the
right
again
across
the
level
space
plunged
down
a
thick
wooded
slope
.
The
Orcs
whom
we
pursued
took
captive
two
of
my
friends
.
In
the
afternoon
Ugluk's	B-PER
troop
overtook
the
Northerners
.
My
Precious
!
O
my
Precious
!
And
with
that
,
even
as
his
eyes
were
lifted
up
to
gloat
on
his
prize
,
he
stepped
too
far
,
toppled
,
wavered
for
a
moment
on
the
brink
,
and
then
with
a
shriek
he
fell
.
That
cheered
them
greatly
;
for
it
was
good
to
see
a
sight
of
anything
beyond
the
wood’s
borders
,
though
they
did
not
mean
to
go
that
way
,
if
they
could
help
it
:
the
Barrow	B-LOC
downs	I-LOC
had
as
sinister
a
reputation
in
hobbit
legend
as
the
Forest
itself
.
They
had
done
nearly
fourteen
miles
with
only
one
rest
at
noon
.
More
difficult
,
not
so
quick
;
but
better
,
if
we
don't
want
Him
to
see
.
Do
not
let
him
run
away
!
said
Boromir	B-PER
.
Beside
Glorfindel	B-PER
there
were
several
other
counsellors
of
Elrond’s	B-PER
household
,
of
whom
Erestor	B-PER
was
the
chief
;
and
with
him
was
Galdor	B-PER
,
an
Elf
from
the
Grey	B-LOC
Havens	I-LOC
who
had
come
on
an
errand
from
Cirdan	B-PER
the
Shipwright
.
The
travellers
now
rode
with
more
speed
,
and
they
made
their
way
towards
the
Gap	B-LOC
of	I-LOC
Rohan	I-LOC
;
and
Aragorn	B-PER
took
leave
of
them
at
last
close
to
that
very
place
where
Pippin	B-PER
had
looked
into
the
Stone
of
Orthanc	B-LOC
.
And
thereupon
the
middle
door
of
the
Black	B-LOC
Gate	I-LOC
was
thrown
open
with
a
great
clang
,
and
out
of
it
there
came
an
embassy
from
the
Dark	B-LOC
Tower	I-LOC
.
Leastways
old
Bilbo	B-PER
was
cracked
,
and
Frodo’s	B-PER
cracking
.
I
saw
a
dark
sky
,
and
tall
battlements
,
he
said
.
Go
on
!
’
said
Frodo	B-PER
.
Is
it
not
a
law
in
the
City
that
those
who
wear
the
black
and
silver
must
stay
in
the
Citadel
,
unless
their
lord
gives
them
leave
?
He
has
,
said
Pippin	B-PER
.
And
I
don't
wish
to
enter
it
even
once
,
said
Pippin	B-PER
.
It
depends
on
many
chances
.
Gloom
settled
still
more
heavily
on
Pippin	B-PER
.
He
felt
that
he
was
lying
in
a
soft
slimy
bog
,
and
springing
up
he
set
his
fool
on
the
corner
of
a
cold
hard
flagstone
.
It
is
no
good
saying
any
more
.
All
they
could
do
was
to
follow
the
fold
downwards
.
Why
that
way
,
I
wonder
?
He
turned
.
But
if
you
ll
pardon
my
speaking
out
,
I
think
my
master
was
right
.
Ever
the
horn
blasts
wound
on
among
the
hills
;
nearer
now
and
louder
they
answered
one
to
another
,
blowing
fierce
and
free
.
Well
,
’
the
farmer
continued
,
approaching
his
point
with
slow
relish
,
he
came
riding
on
a
big
black
horse
in
at
the
gate
,
which
happened
to
be
open
,
and
right
up
to
my
door
.
All
that
he
could
remember
about
Rohan	B-LOC
was
that
Gandalf's	B-PER
horse
,
Shadowfax	B-PER
,
had
come
from
that
land
.
Smeagol	B-PER
helps
again
.
We
cannot
go
further
tonight
,
’
said
Boromir	B-PER
.
I
think
,
nonetheless
,
that
we
no
longer
need
any
trail
to
tell
us
which
way
to
go
,
said
Gimli	B-PER
.
Do
Elves
live
in
those
woods
?
he
asked
.
Stone
rings
grinned
out
of
the
ground
like
broken
teeth
in
the
moonlight
.
Indeed
the
hobbits
felt
that
the
hair
on
their
heads
was
actually
standing
up
,
waving
and
curling
and
growing
.
Must
get
up
,
yes
they
must
!
he
said
.
In
pairs
they
galloped
by
,
and
though
every
now
and
then
one
rose
in
his
stirrups
and
gazed
ahead
and
to
either
side
,
they
appeared
not
to
perceive
the
three
strangers
sitting
silently
and
watching
them
.
But
he
came
too
late
,
for
once
,
and
the
battle
was
over
and
beyond
his
help
before
he
reached
these
parts
.
If
there
are
hobbit
folk
in
these
pans
,
why
don't
we
look
for
some
that
would
be
willing
to
take
us
in
?
It
would
be
more
homelike
.
We
feared
that
Saruman	B-PER
was
brewing
some
new
devilry
for
us
.
I
wonder
,
said
Strider	B-PER
,
looking
round
thoughtfully
.
Still
,
he
said
,
standing
suddenly
up
and
sticking
out
his
chin
.
All
that
day
the
Company	B-ORG
marched
on
,
until
they
felt
the
cool
evening
come
and
heard
the
early
night
wind
whispering
among
many
leaves
.
’
Legolas	B-PER
stirred
in
his
boat
.
Where
d
you
think
you
re
going
?
said
one
,
the
largest
and
most
evil
looking
of
the
crew
.
I
should
like
a
bit
of
information
as
well
as
danger
.
Some
I
cannot
trust
,
and
those
I
can
trust
are
too
dear
to
me
:
poor
old
Sam	B-PER
,
and
Merry	B-PER
and
Pippin	B-PER
.
He
sighed
.
As
Frodo	B-PER
prepared
to
follow
him
,
he
laid
his
hand
upon
the
tree
beside
the
ladder
:
never
before
had
he
been
so
suddenly
and
so
keenly
aware
of
the
feel
and
texture
of
a
tree's
skin
and
of
the
life
within
it
.
He
has
led
us
in
here
against
our
fears
,
but
he
will
lead
us
out
again
,
at
whatever
cost
to
himself
.
But
now
Frodo	B-PER
often
met
strange
dwarves
of
far
countries
,
seeking
refuge
in
the
West
.
There's
more
stored
in
your
head
than
you
let
on
about
.
’
Yes
,
it
all
comes
back
to
me
now
,
’
said
Frodo	B-PER
:
the
tremen
dous
roaring
.
I
will
not
do
this
deed
.
There
was
nothing
to
be
seen
.
He
knows
it
.
Think
of
the
riddles
they
both
knew
,
for
one
thing
.
Not
far
beyond
them
the
stream
becomes
clear
and
smooth
again
,
though
it
runs
swiftly
.
And
then
they
lost
no
more
time
.
A
strong
wind
from
the
West
was
now
driving
the
fumes
of
Mordor	B-LOC
from
the
upper
airs
.
I
should
know
,
for
I
had
one
to
tend
in
the
Houses
.
And
nothing
will
ever
be
all
right
where
that
piece
of
misery
is
.
’
Dangerous
or
not
,
a
real
sunrise
is
mighty
welcome
,
’
said
Frodo	B-PER
,
throwing
back
his
hood
and
letting
the
morning
light
fall
on
his
face
.
It
seemed
different
so
far
away
,
in
the
Shire	B-LOC
or
in
Rivendell	B-LOC
.
He
gazed
back
along
the
way
that
they
had
come
towards
the
night
gathering
in
the
East
.
Black
Riders
would
have
to
ride
over
him
to
get
near
the
waggon
.
At
last
lulled
by
the
wind
in
the
boughs
above
,
and
the
sweet
murmur
of
the
falls	B-LOC
of	I-LOC
Nimrodel	I-LOC
below
,
Frodo	B-PER
fell
asleep
with
the
song
of
Legolas	B-PER
running
in
his
mind
.
Yes
,
to
Mordor	B-LOC
,
’
said
Gandalf	B-PER
.
Beside
him
Merry	B-PER
lay
,
white
faced
,
with
a
dirty
rag
bound
across
his
brows
.
But
Aragorn	B-PER
dismounted
,
and
standing
by
the
Stone
he
cried
in
a
great
voice
:
Oathbreakers
,
why
have
ye
come
?
And
a
voice
was
heard
out
of
the
night
that
answered
him
,
as
if
from
far
away
:
To
fulfil
our
oath
and
have
peace
.
Before
long
they
had
all
passed
and
vanished
.
Soon
the
white
form
of
the
Lady
was
small
and
distant
.
Do
you
advise
me
to
look
?
asked
Frodo	B-PER
.
Ah
!
said
Aragorn	B-PER
.
And
then
there
are
some
trees
in
the
valleys
under
the
mountains
,
sound
as
a
bell
,
and
bad
right
through
.
The
rivers
long
defended
us
,
but
they
are
a
sure
guard
no
more
;
for
the
Shadow
has
crept
northward
all
about
us
.
There
are
none
.
In
their
dark
cloaks
they
were
as
invisible
as
if
they
all
had
magic
rings
.
Aragorn	B-PER
strode
on
through
the
inner
court
,
and
mounted
to
a
high
chamber
in
the
tower
.
Only
a
remnant
of
our
eastern
force
came
back
,
destroying
the
last
bridge
that
still
stood
amid
the
ruins	B-LOC
of	I-LOC
Osgiliath	I-LOC
.
Speak
no
more
of
it
!
But
so
it
is
,
Sam	B-PER
:
in
that
land
you
lost
your
count
.
It
is
cold
in
the
tree
tops
in
winter
,
though
the
wind
tonight
is
in
the
South
;
but
we
have
food
and
drink
to
give
you
that
will
drive
away
the
night
chill
,
and
we
have
skins
and
cloaks
to
spare
.
That’s
good
for
a
beginning
.
He
looked
on
the
bright
point
of
the
sword
.
They
roared
and
boomed
and
trumpeted
,
until
stones
began
to
crack
and
fall
at
the
mere
noise
of
them
.
’
The
night
wind
blew
chill
up
the
valley
to
meet
them
.
But
never
mind
.
The
three
hobbits
came
on
,
and
then
the
ruffians
turned
and
fled
running
away
up
the
Hobbiton	B-LOC
Road	I-LOC
;
but
they
blew
their
horns
as
they
ran
.
You
will
learn
that
your
trouble
is
but
part
of
the
trouble
of
all
the
western
world
.
I
reckon
it
isn't
safe
for
us
both
to
sleep
together
,
and
begging
your
pardon
,
but
I
can't
hold
up
my
lids
much
longer
.
So
I
stayed
there
that
night
,
wondering
much
what
had
become
of
the
Riders
;
for
only
of
two
had
there
yet
been
any
news
in
Bree	B-LOC
,
it
seemed
.
Give
me
your
bow
.
Great
trees
passed
by
like
ghosts
,
thrusting
their
twisted
thirsty
roots
through
the
mist
down
into
the
water
.
But
now
the
world
is
changing
once
again
.
The
dining
room
was
bare
except
for
a
table
and
chairs
,
but
the
food
was
good
,
and
there
was
good
wine
:
Frodo’s	B-PER
wine
had
not
been
included
in
the
sale
to
the
Sackville	B-PER
Bagginses	I-PER
.
The
world
was
darkling
.
The
others
slunk
away
.
I
have
returned
from
the
Northern	B-LOC
Fences	I-LOC
,
said
the
Elf
,
and
I
am
sent
now
to
be
your
guide
again
.
Swans
!
said
Sam	B-PER
.
Why
!
You
can't
see
to
the
bottom
in
this
light
.
It
will
not
be
any
comfort
to
us
,
if
these
riders
discover
that
we
are
not
Orcs
after
we
are
dead
.
Sam	B-PER
looked
at
Frodo	B-PER
.
Do
as
you
please
in
your
madness
,
but
let
me
first
get
down
from
this
horse
!
I
wish
to
see
no
eyes
!
Stay
,
Legolas	B-PER
Greenleaf	I-PER
!
said
Gandalf	B-PER
.
But
I
can't
keep
awake
any
longer
.
The
swords
flashed
from
the
sheath
as
one
.
They
just
want
a
match
,
though
,
and
they
ll
go
up
in
fire
.
I
need
a
change
,
or
something
.
The
cut
is
not
poisoned
,
as
the
wounds
of
orc
blades
too
often
are
.
My
heart
tells
me
that
Sauron	B-PER
will
expect
us
to
take
the
western
way
,
when
he
learns
what
has
befallen
.
The
day
waned
,
and
dusk
was
twined
about
the
boles
of
the
trees
.
Why
,
cousin
,
one
of
them
went
with
only
his
esquire
into
the
Black	B-LOC
Country	I-LOC
and
fought
with
the
Dark	B-PER
Lord	I-LORD
all
by
himself
,
and
set
fire
to
his
Tower
,
if
you
can
believe
it
.
Those
who
no
longer
wish
to
go
forward
may
remain
here
,
for
a
while
.
I’ll
say
you’re
dead
,
or
have
left
the
Shire	B-LOC
,
or
anything
you
like
.
