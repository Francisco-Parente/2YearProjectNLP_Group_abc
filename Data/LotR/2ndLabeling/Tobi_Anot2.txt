At 
the
end
of
the
second
week
in
September
a
cart
came
in
through
Bywater	B-LOC
from
the
direction
of
Brandy	B-LOC
wine	I-LOC
Bridge	I-LOC
in
broad
daylight
.
An
old
man
was
driving
it
all
alone
.
He
wore
a
tall
pointed
blue
hat
,
a
long
grey
cloak
,
and
a
silver
scarf
.
He
had
a
long
white
beard
and
bushy
eyebrows
that
stuck
out
beyond
the
brim
of
his
hat
.
Small
hobbit
children
ran
after
the
cart
all
through
Hobbiton	B-LOC
and
right
up
the
hill
.
It
had
a
cargo
of
fireworks
,
as
they
rightly
guessed
.
At
Bilbo’s	B-PER
front
door
the
old
man
began
to
unload
:
there
were
great
bundles
of
fireworks
of
all
sorts
and
shapes
,
each
labelled
with
a
large
red
G
and
the
elf
rune
,
JJ
!
That
was
Gandalf’s	B-PER
mark
,
of
course
,
and
the
old
man
was
Gandalf	B-PER
the
Wizard 
,
whose
fame
in
the
Shire	B-LOC
was
due
mainly
to
his
skill
with
fires
,
smokes
,
and
lights
.
His
real
business
was
far
more
difficult
and
dangerous
,
but
the
Shire	B-LOC
folk
knew
nothing
about
it
.
To
them
he
was
just
one
of
the
attractions’
at
the
Party B-LOC
.
Hence
the
excitement
of
the
hobbit
children
.
G
for
Grand
!
’
they
shouted
,
and
the
old
man
smiled
.
They
knew
him
by
sight
,
though
he
only
appeared
in
Hobbiton B-LOC
occasionally
and
never
stopped
long
;
but
neither
they
nor
any
but
the
oldest
of
their
elders
had
seen
one
of
his
firework
displays
they
now
belonged
to
a
legendary
past
.
When
the
old
man
,
helped
by
Bilbo B-PER
and
some
dwarves
,
had
finished
unloading
,
Bilbo B-PER
gave
a
few
pennies
away
;
but
not
a
single
squib
or
cracker
was
forthcoming
,
to
the
dis
appointment
of
the
onlookers
.
Run
away
now
!
’
said
Gandalf	B-PER
.
You
will
get
plenty
when
the
time
comes
.
’
Then
he
disappeared
inside
with
Bilbo B-PER
,
and
the
door
was
shut
.
The
young
hobbits
stared
at
the
door
in
vain
for
a
while
,
and
then
made
off
,
feeling
that
the
day
of
the
party
would
never
come
.
Inside
Bag B-LOC
End I-LOC
,
Bilbo B-PER
and
Gandalf B-PER
were
sitting
at
the
open
window
of
a
small
room
looking
out
west
on
to
the
garden
.
The
late
afternoon
was
bright
and
peaceful
.
The
flowers
glowed
red
and
golden
:
snap
dragons
and
sunflowers
,
and
nasturtians
trailing
all
over
the
turf
walls
and
peeping
in
at
the
round
windows
.
How
bright
your
garden
looks
!
’
said
Gandalf B-PER
.
Yes
,
’
said
Bilbo B-PER
.
I
am
very
fond
indeed
of
it
,
and
of
all
the
dear
old
Shire B-LOC
;
but
I
think
I
need
a
holiday
.
’
You
mean
to
go
on
with
your
plan
then
?
’
I
do
.
I
made
up
my
mind
months
ago
,
and
I
haven’t
changed
it
.
’
Very
well
.
It
is
no
good
saying
any
more
.
Stick
to
your
plan
your
whole
plan
,
mind
and
I
hope
it
will
turn
out
for
the
best
,
for
you
,
and
for
all
of
us
.
’
I
hope
so
.
Anyway
I
mean
to
enjoy
myself
on
Thursday
,
and
have
my
little
joke
.
’
Who
will
laugh
,
I
wonder
?
’
said
Gandalf B-PER
,
shaking
his
head
.
We
shall
see
,
’
said
Bilbo	B-PER
.
The
next
day
more
carts
rolled
up
the
Hill	B-LOC
,
and
still
more
carts
.
There
might
have
been
some
grumbling
about
dealing
locally’
,
but
that
very
week
orders
began
to
pour
out
of
Bag
End
for
every
kind
of
provision
,
commodity
,
or
luxury
that
could
be
obtained
in
Hobbiton	B-LOC
or
Bywater	B-LOC
or
anywhere
in
the
neighbourhood
.
People
became
enthusiastic
;
and
they
began
to
tick
off
the
days
on
the
calendar
;
and
they
watched
eagerly
for
the
postman
,
hoping
for
invitations
.
Before
long
the
invitations
began
pouring
out
,
and
the
Hobbiton	B-LOC
post
office
was
blocked
,
and
the
Bywater	B-ORG
post 	I-ORG
office I-ORG
was
snowed
under
,
and
voluntary
assistant
postmen
were
called
for
.
There
was
a
constant
stream
of
them
going
up
the
Hill B-LOC
,
carrying
hundreds
of
polite
variations
on
Thank
you
,
I
shall
certainly
come
.
A
notice
appeared
on
the
gate
at
Bag B-LOC
End I-LOC
:
no
admit
tance
except
on
party
business
.
Even
those
who
had
,
or
pretended
to
have
Party
Business
were
seldom
allowed
inside
.
Bilbo	B-PER
was
busy
:
writing
invitations
,
ticking
off
answers
,
packing
up
presents
,
and
making
some
private
preparations
of
his
own
.
From
the
time
of
Gandalf	B-PER
’s
arrival
he
remained
hidden
from
view
.
One
morning
the
hobbits
woke
to
find
the
large
field
,
south
of
Bilbo’s	B-PER
front
door
,
covered
with
ropes
and
poles
for
tents
and
pavilions
.
A
special
entrance
was
cut
into
the
bank
leading
to
the
road
,
and
wide
steps
and
a
large
white
gate
were
built
there
.
The
three
hobbit
families
of
Bagshot	B-LOC
Row	I-LOC
,
adjoining
the
field
,
were
intensely
interested
and
generally
envied
.
Old B-PER
Gaffer	I-PER
Gamgee	I-PER
stopped
even
pretending
to
work
in
his
garden
.
The
tents
began
to
go
up
.
There
was
a
specially
large
pavilion
,
so
big
that
the
tree
that
grew
in
the
field
was
right
inside
it
,
and
stood
proudly
near
one
end
,
at
the
head
of
the
chief
table
.
Lanterns
were
hung
on
all
its
branches
.
More
promising
still
(
to
the
hobbits’
mind
)
:
an
enormous
open
air
kitchen
was
erected
in
the
north
corner
of
the
field
.
A
draught
of
cooks
,
from
every
inn	B-ORG
and
eating	B-ORG
house	I-ORG
for
miles
around
,
arrived
to
supplement
the
dwarves
and
other
odd
folic
that
were
quartered
at
Bag	B-LOC
End	I-LOC
.
Excitement
rose
to
its
height
.
Then
the
weather
clouded
over
.
That
was
on
Wednesday
the
eve
of
the
Party
.
Anxiety
was
intense
.
Then
Thursday
,
September
the
22nd
,
actually
dawned
.
The
sun
got
up
,
the
clouds
vanished
,
flags
were
unfurled
and
the
fun
began
.
Bilbo	B-PER
Baggins	I-PER
called
it
a
party
,
but
it
was
really
a
variety
of
entertainments
rolled
into
one
.
Practically
everybody
living
near
was
invited
.
A
very
few
were
overlooked
by
accident
,
but
as
they
turned
up
all
the
same
,
that
did
not
matter
.
Many
people
from
other
parts
of
the
Shire B-LOC
were
also
asked
;
and
there
were
even
a
few
from
outside
the
borders
.
Bilbo B-PER
met
the
guests
(
and
additions
)
at
the
new 
white
gate
in
person
.
He
gave
away
presents
to
all
and
sundry
the
latter
were
those
who
went
out
again
by
a
back
way
and
came
in
again
by
the
gate
.
Hobbits
give
presents
to
other
people
on
their
own
birthdays
.
Not
very
expensive
ones
,
as
a
rule
,
and
not
so
lavishly
as
on
this
occasion
;
but
it
was
not
a
bad
system
.
Actually
in
Hobbiton	B-LOC
and
Bywater	B-LOC
every
day
in
the
year
was
somebody’s
birthday
,
so
that
every
hobbit
in
those
parts
had
a
fair
chance
of
at
least
one
present
at
least
once
a
week
.
But
they
never
got
tired
of
them
.
On
this
occasion
the
presents
were
unusually
good
.
The
hobbit
children
were
so
excited
that
for
a
while
they
almost
forgot
about
eating
.
There
were
toys
the
like
of
which
they
had
never
seen
before
,
all
beautiful
and
some
obviously
magi
cal
.
Many
of
them
had
indeed
been
ordered
a
year
before
,
and
had
come
all
the
way
from
the
Mountain	B-LOC
and
from
Dale	B-LOC
,
and
were
of
real
dwarf
make
.
When
every
guest
had
been
welcomed
and
was
finally
inside
the
gate
,
there
were
songs
,
dances
,
music
,
games
,
and
,
of
course
,
food
and
drink
.
There
were
three
official
meals
:
lunch
,
tea
,
and
dinner
(
or
supper
)
.
But
lunch
and
tea
were
marked
chiefly
by
the
fact
that
at
those
times
all
the
guests
were
sitting
down
and
eating
together
.
At
other
times
there
were
merely
lots
of
people
eating
and
drinking
continuously
from
elevenses
until
six
thirty
,
when
the
fireworks
started
.
The
fireworks
were
by
Gandalf	B-PER
:
they
were
not
only
brought
by
him
,
but
designed
and
made
by
him
;
and
the
special
effects
,
set
pieces
,
and
flights
of
rockets
were
let
off
by
him
.
But
there
was
also
a
generous
distribution
of
squibs
,
crackers
,
backarappers
,
sparklers
,
torches
,
dwarf
candles
,
elf
fountains
,
goblin
barkers
and
thunder
claps
.
They
were
all
superb
.
The
art
of
Gandalf	B-PER
improved
with
age
.
There
were
rockets
like
a
flight
of
scintillating
birds
singing
with
sweet
voices
.
There
were
green
trees
with
trunks
of
dark
smoke
:
their
leaves
opened
like
a
whole
spring
unfolding
in
a
moment
,
and
their
shining
branches
dropped
glowing
flowers
down
upon
the
astonished
hobbits
,
disappearing
with
a
sweet
scent
just
before
they
touched
their
upturned
faces
.
There
were
fountains
of
butterflies
that
flew
glittering
into
the
trees
;
there
were
pillars
of
coloured
fires
that
rose
and
turned
into
eagles
,
or
sailing
ships
,
or
a
phalanx
of
flying
swans
;
there
was
a
red
thunderstorm
and
a
shower
of
yellow
rain
;
there
was
a
forest
of
silver
spears
that
sprang
suddenly
into
the
air
with
a
yell
like
an
embattled
army
,
and
came
down
again
into
the
Water
with
a
hiss
like
a
hundred
hot
snakes
.
And
there
was
also
one
last
surprise
,
in
honour
of
Bilbo	B-PER
,
and
it
startled
the
hobbits
exceedingly
,
as
Gandalf	B-PER
intended
.
The
lights
went
out
.
A
great
smoke
went
up
.
It
shaped
itself
like
a
mountain
seen
in
the
distance
,
and
began
to
glow
at
the
summit
.
It
spouted
green
and
scarlet
flames
.
Out
flew
a
red
golden
dragon
not
life
size
,
but
terribly
life
like
:
fire
came
from
his
jaws
,
his
eyes
glared
down
;
there
was
a
roar
,
and
he
whizzed
three
times
over
the
heads
of
the
crowd
.
They
all
ducked
,
and
many
fell
flat
on
their
faces
.
The
dragon
passed
like
an
express
train
,
turned
a
somersault
,
and
burst
over
Bywater	B-PER
with
a
deafening
explosion
.
That
is
the
signal
for
supper
!
’
said
Bilbo	B-PER
.
The
pain
and
alarm
vanished
at
once
,
and
the
prostrate
hobbits
leaped
to
their
feet
.
There
was
a
splendid
supper
for
everyone
;
for
everyone
,
that
is
,
except
those
invited
to
the
special
family
dinner
party
.
This
was
held
in
the
great
pavilion
with
the
tree
.
The
invitations
were
limited
to
twelve
dozen
(
a
number
also
called
by
the
hobbits
one
Gross
,
though
the
word
was
not
considered
proper
to
use
of
people
)
;
and
the
guests
were
selected
from
all
the
families
to
which
Bilbo	B-PER
and
Frodo	B-PER
were
related
,
with
the
addition
of
a
few
special
unrelated
friends
(
such
as
Gandalf	B-PER
)
.
Many
young
hobbits
were
included
,
and
present
by
parental
permission
;
for
hobbits
were
easy
going
with
their
children
in
the
matter
of
sitting
up
late
,
especially
when
there
was
a
chance
of
getting
them
a
free
meal
.
Bringing
up
young
hobbits
took
a
lot
of
provender
.
There
were
many
Bagginses	B-PER
and
Boffins	B-PER
,
and
also
many
Tooks	B-PER
and
Brandybucks	B-PER
;
there
were
various
Grubbs	B-PER
(
re
lations
of
Bilbo	B-PER
Baggins’	I-PER
grandmother
)
,
and
various
Chubbs	B-PER
(
connexions
of
his
Took	B-PER
grandfather
)
;
and
a
selection
of
Burrowses	B-PER
,
Bolgers	B-PER
,
Bracegirdles	B-PER
,
Brockhouses	B-PER
,
Goodbodies	B-PER
,
Hornblowers	B-PER
and
Proudfoots	B-PER
.
Some
of
these
were
only
very
distantly
connected
with
Bilbo	B-PER
,
and
some
had
hardly
ever
been
in
Hobbiton	B-LOC
before
,
as
they
lived
in
remote
corners
of
the
Shire	B-LOC
.
The
Sackville	B-PER
Bagginses	I-PER
were
not
forgotten
.
Otho	B-PER
and
his
wife
Lobelia	B-PER
were
present
.
They
disliked
Bilbo	B-PER	
and
detested
Frodo	B-PER
,
but
so
magnificent
was
the
invitation
card
,
written
in
golden
ink
,
that
they
had
felt
it
was
impossible
to
refuse
.
Besides
,
their
cousin
,
Bilbo	B-PER
,
had
been
specializing
in
food
for
many
years
and
his
table
had
a
high
reputation
.
All
the
one
hundred
and
forty
four
guests
expected
a
pleas
ant
feast
;
though
they
rather
dreaded
the
after
dinner
speech
of
their
host
(
an
inevitable
item
)
.
He
was
liable
to
drag
in
bits
of
what
he
called
poetry
;
and
sometimes
,
after
a
glass
or
two
,
would
allude
to
the
absurd
adventures
of
his
mysterious
journey
.
The
guests
were
not
disappointed
:
they
had
a
very
pleasant
feast
,
in
fact
an
engrossing
entertainment
:
rich
,
abundant
,
varied
,
and
prolonged
.
The
purchase
of
provisions
fell
almost
to
nothing
throughout
the
district	B-LOC
in
the
ensuing
weeks
;
but
as
Bilbo’s	B-PER
catering
had
depleted
the
stocks
of
most
of
the
stores
,
cellars
and
warehouses
for
miles
around
,
that
did
not
matter
much
.
After
the
feast
(
more
or
less
)
came
the
Speech
.
Most
of
the
company
were
,
however
,
now
in
a
tolerant
mood
,
at
that
delightful
stage
which
they
called
filling
up
the
corners’
.
They
were
sipping
their
favourite
drinks
,
and
nibbling
at
their
favourite
dainties
,
and
their
fears
were
forgotten
.
They
were
prepared
to
listen
to
anything
,
and
to
cheer
at
every
full
stop
.
My
dear
People
,
began
Bilbo	B-PER
,
rising
in
his
place
.
Hear
!
Hear
!
Hear
!
’
they
shouted
,
and
kept
on
repeating
it
in
chorus
,
seeming
reluctant
to
follow
their
own
advice
.
Bilbo	B-PER
left
his
place
and
went
and
stood
on
a
chair
under
the
illuminated
tree
.
The
light
of
the
lanterns
fell
on
his
beaming
face
;
the
golden
buttons
shone
on
his
embroidered
silk
waistcoat
.
They
could
all
see
him
standing
,
waving
one
hand
in
the
air
,
the
other
was
in
his
trouser
pocket
.
My
dear
Bagginses B-PER
and
Boffins B-PER
,
he
began
again
;
and
my
dear
Books	B-PER
and
Brandybucks	B-PER
,
and
Grubbs	B-PER
,
and
Chubbs	B-PER
,
and
Burrowses	B-PER
,
and
Hornblowers	B-PER
,
and
Bolgers	B-PER
,
Bracegirdles	B-PER
,
Good
bodies
,
Brockhouses	B-PER
and
Proudfoots	B-PER
.
ProudFEETl’	B-PER
shouted
an
elderly
hobbit
from
the
back
of
the
pavilion
.
His
name
,
of
course
,
was
Proudfoot	B-PER
,
and
well
merited
;
his
feet
were
large
,
exceptionally
furry
,
and
both
were
on
the
table
.
Proudfoots	B-PER
,
repeated
Bilbo	B-PER
.
Also
my
good
Sackville	B-PER
Bagginses	I-PER
that
I
welcome
back
at
last
to
Bag	B-LOC
End	I-LOC
.
