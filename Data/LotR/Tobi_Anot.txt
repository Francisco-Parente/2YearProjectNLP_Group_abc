When  
Mr. 
Bilbo B-PER
Baggins I-PER
of
Bag B-LOC
End I-LOC
announced
that
he
would
shortly
be
celebrating
his
eleventy
first
birthday
with
a
party
of
special
magnificence
,
there
was
much
talk
and
excitement
in
Hobbiton B-LOC
.
Bilbo B-PER
was
very
rich
and
very
peculiar
,
and
had
been
the
wonder
of
the
Shire B-LOC
for
sixty
years
,
ever
since
his
remarkable
disappearance
and
unexpected
return
.
The
riches 
he
had
brought
back
from
his
travels
had
now
become
a
local
legend
,
and
it
was
popularly
believed
,
whatever
the
old
folk
might
say
,
that
the
Hill B-LOC
at
Bag B-LOC
End I-LOC
was
full
of
tunnels
stuffed
with
treasure
.
And
if
that
was
not
enough
for
fame
,
there
was
also
his
prolonged
vigour
to
marvel
at
.
Time
wore
on
,
but
it
seemed
to
have
little
effect
on
Mr.
Baggins B-PER
.
At
ninety
he
was
much
the
same
as
at
fifty
.
At
ninety
nine
they
began
to
call
him
well
preserved
,
but
unchanged
would
have
been
nearer
the
mark
.
There
were
some
that
shook
their
heads
and
thought
this
was
too
much
of
a
good
thing
;
it
seemed
unfair
that
anyone
should
possess
(
apparently
)
perpetual
youth
as
well
as
(
reputedly
)
inexhaustible
wealth
.
It
will
have
to
be
paid
for
,
’
they
said
.
It
isn’t
natural
,
and
trouble
will
come
of
it
!
’
But
so
far
trouble
had
not
come
;
and
as
Mr.
Baggins B-PER
was
generous
with
his
money
,
most
people
were
willing
to
for
give
him
his
oddities
and
his
good
fortune
.
He
remained
on
visiting
terms
with
his
relatives
(
except
,
of
course
,
the
Sackville B-PER
Bagginses I-PER
)
,
and
he
had
many
devoted
admirers
among
the
hobbits B-OTH
of
poor
and
unimportant
families
.
But
he
had
no
close
friends
,
until
some
of
his
younger
cousins
began
to
grow
up
.
The
eldest
of
these
,
and
Bilbo’s B-PER
favourite
,
was
young
Frodo B-PER
Baggins I-PER
.
When
Bilbo B-PER
was
ninety
nine
he
adopted
Frodo B-PER
as
his
heir
,
and
brought
him
to
live
at
Bag B-LOC
End I-LOC
;
and
the
hopes
of
the
Sackville B-PER
Bagginses I-PER
were
finally
dashed
.
Bilbo B-PER
and
Frodo B-PER
happened
to
have
the
same
birthday
,
September
22nd
.
You
had
better
come
and
live
here
,
Frodo B-PER
my
lad
,
’
said
Bilbo B-PER
one
day
;
and
then
we
can
celebrate
our
birthday
parties
comfortably
together
.
’
At
that
time
Frodo B-PER
was
still
in
his
tweens
,
as
the
hobbits B-OTH
called
the
irresponsible
twenties
between
childhood
and
coming
of
age
at
thirty
three
.
Twelve
more
years
passed
.
Each
year
the
Bagginses B-PER
had
given
very
lively
combined
birthday
parties
at
Bag B-LOC
End I-LOC
;
but
now
it
was
understood
that
something
quite
exceptional
was
being
planned
for
that
autumn
.
Bilbo B-PER
was
going
to
be
eleventy
one
,
ill
,
a
rather
curious
number
,
and
a
very
re
spectable
age
for
a
hobbit B-OTH
(
the
Old B-PER
Took I-PER
himself
had
only
reached
130
)
;
and
Frodo B-PER
was
going
to
be
thirty
three
,
33
,
an
important
number
:
the
date
of
his
coming
of
age’
.
Tongues
began
to
wag
in
Hobbiton B-LOC
and
Bywater B-Loc
;
and
rumour
of
the
coming
event
travelled
all
over
the
Shire b-loc
.
The
history
and
character
of
Mr.
Bilbo B-PER
Baggins I-PER
became
once
again
the
chief
topic
of
conversation
;
and
the
older
folk
suddenly
found
their
reminiscences
in
welcome
demand
.
No
one
had
a
more
attentive
audience
than
old
Flam B-PER
Gamgee I-PER
,
commonly
known
as
the
Gaffer B-PER
.
Fie
held
forth
at
The
Ivy B-LOC
Bush I-LOC
,
a
small
inn
on
the
Bywater B-LOC
road
;
and
he
spoke
with
some
authority
,
for
he
had
tended
the
garden
at
Bag B-LOC
End I-LOC
for
forty
years
,
and
had
helped
old
Holman B-PER
in
the
same
job
before
that
.
Now
that
he
was
himself
growing
old
and
stiff
in
the
joints
,
the
job
was
mainly
carried
on
by
his
young
est
son
,
Sam B-PER
Gamgee I-PER
.
Both
father
and
son
were
on
very
friendly
terms
with
Bilbo B-PER
and
Frodo B-PER
.
They
lived
on
the
Hill B-LOC
itself
,
in
Number
3 B-LOC
Bagshot I-LOC
Row I-LOC
just
below
Bag B-LOC
End I-LOC
.
A
very
nice
well
spoken
gentlehobbit
is
Mr.
Bilbo B-PER
,
as
I’ve
always
said
,
’
the
Gaffer B-PER
declared
.
With
perfect
truth
:
for
Bilbo B-PER
was
very
polite
to
him
,
calling
him
Master
Hamfast’ B-PER
,
and
consulting
him
constantly
upon
the
growing
of
vegetables
in
the
matter
of
roots’
,
especially
potatoes
,
the
Gaffer B-PER
was
recognized
as
the
leading
authority
by
all
in
the
neighbour
hood
(
including
himself
)
.
But
what
about
this
Frodo B-PER
that
lives
with
him
?
’
asked
Old B-PER
Noakes I-PER
of
Bywater B-LOC 
.
Baggins B-PER
is
his
name
,
but
he’s
more
than
half
a
Brandybuck B-PER
,
they
say
.
It
beats
me
why
any
Baggins B-PER
of
Hobbiton B-LOC
should
go
looking
for
a
wife
away
there
in
Buckland B-LOC
,
where
folks
are
so
queer
.
’
And
no
wonder
they’re
queer
,
’
put
in
Daddy B-PER
Twofoot I-PER
(
the
Gaffer’s
next
door
neighbour
)
,
if
they
live
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
Brandywine B-LOC
River I-LOC
,
and
right
agin
the
Old B-LOC
Forest I-LOC
.
That’s
a
dark
bad
place
,
if
half
the
tales
be
true
.
’
You’re
right
,
Dad 
!
’
said
the
Gaffer B-PER
.
Not
that
the
Brandy 
bucks 
of
Buckland B-LOC
live
in
the
Old B-LOC
Forest I-LOC
;
but
they’re
a
queer
breed
,
seemingly
.
They
fool
about
with
boats
on
that
big
river
and
that
isn’t
natural
.
Small
wonder
that
trouble
came
of
it
,
I
say
.
But
be
that
as
it
may
,
Mr.
Frodo B-PER
is
as
nice
a
young
hobbit B-OTH
as
you
could
wish
to
meet
.
Very
much
like
Mr.
Bilbo B-PER
,
and
in
more
than
looks
.
After
all
his
father
was
a
Baggins B-PER
.
A
decent
respectable
hobbit B-OTH
was
Mr.
Drogo B-PER
Baggins I-PER
; 
there
was
never
much
to
tell
of
him
,
till
he
was
drownded
.
’
Drownded
?
’
said
several
voices
.
They
had
heard
this
and
other
darker
rumours
before
,
of
course
;
but
hobbits B-OTH
have
a
passion
for
family
history
,
and
they
were
ready
to
hear
it
again
.
Well
,
so
they
say
,
’
said
the
Gaffer B-PER
.
You
see
:
Mr.
Drogo B-PER
,
he
married
poor
Miss
Primula B-PER
Brandybuck I-PER
.
She
was
our
Mr.
Bilbo’s B-PER
first
cousin
on
the
mother’s
side
(
her
mother
being
the
youngest
of
the
Old B-PER
Took’s I-PER
daughters
)
;
and
Mr.
Drogo B-PER
was
his
second
cousin
.
So
Mr.
Frodo B-PER
is
his
first
and
second
cousin
,
once
removed
either
way
,
as
the
saying
is
,
if
you
follow
me
.
And
Mr.
Drogo B-PER
was
staying
at
Brandy B-LOC
Hall I-LOC
with
his
father
in
law
,
old
Master 
Gorbadoc B-PER
,
as
he
often
did
after
his
marriage
(
him
being
partial
to
his
vittles
,
and
old
Gorbadoc B-PER
keeping
a
mighty
generous
table
)
;
and
he
went
out
boating
on
the
Brandywine B-LOC
River I-LOC
; 
and
he
and
his
wife
were
drownded
,
and
poor
Mr.
Frodo B-PER
only
a
child
and
all
.
’
I’ve
heard
they
went
on
the
water
after
dinner
in
the
moonlight
,
’
said
Old B-PER
Noakes I-PER
;
and
it
was
Drogo’s B-PER
weight
as
sunk
the
boat
.
’
And
heard
she
pushed
him
in
,
and
he
pulled
her
in
after
him
,
’
said
Sandyman B-PER
,
the
Hobbiton B-LOC
miller
.
You
shouldn’t
listen
to
all
you
hear
,
Sandyman B-PER
,
’
said
the
Gaffer B-PER
,
who
did
not
much
like
the
miller
.
There
isn’t
no
call
to
go
talking
of
pushing
and
pulling
.
Boats
are
quite
tricky
enough
for
those
that
sit
still
without
looking
further
for
the
cause
of
trouble
.
Anyway
:
there
was
this
Mr.
Frodo B-PER
left
an
orphan
and
stranded
,
as
you
might
say
,
among
those
queer
Bucklanders B-PER
,
being
brought
up
anyhow
in
Brandy B-LOC
Hall I-LOC
.
A
regular
warren
,
by
all
accounts
.
Old
Master
Gorbadoc B-PER
never
had
fewer
than
a
couple
of
hundred
relations
in
the
place
.
Mr. 
Bilbo B-PER
never
did
a
kinder
deed
than
when
he
brought
the
lad
back
to
live
among
decent
folk
.
But
I
reckon
it
was
a
nasty
knock
for
those
Sackville B-PER
Bagginses I-PER
.
They
thought
they
were
going
to
get
Bag B-LOC
End I-LOC
,
that
time
when
he
went
off
and
was
thought
to
be
dead
.
And
then
he
comes
back
and
orders
them
off
;
and
he
goes
on
living
and
living
,
and
never
looking
a
day
older
,
bless
him
!
And
suddenly
he
produces
an
heir
,
and
has
all
the
papers
made
out
proper
.
The
Sackville B-PER
Bagginses I-PER
won’t 
never
see
the
inside
of
Bag B-LOC
End I-LOC
now
,
or
it
is
to
be
hoped
not
.
’
There’s
a
tidy
bit
of
money
tucked
away
up
there
,
I
hear
tell
,
’
said
a
stranger
,
a
visitor
on
business
from
Michel B-PER
Delving I-PER
in
the
Westfarthing B-LOC
.
All
the
top
of
your
hill
is
full
of
tunnels
packed
with
chests
of
gold
and
silver
,
and
jools
,
by
what
I’ve
heard
.
’
Then
you’ve
heard
more
than
I
can
speak
to
,
’
answered
the
Gaffer B-PER
.
I
know
nothing
about
jools
.
Mr.
Bilbo B-PER
is
free
with
his
money
,
and
there
seems
no
lack
of
it
;
but
I
know
of
no
tunnel
making
.
I
saw
Mr.
Bilbo B-PER
when
he
came
back
,
a
matter
of
sixty
years
ago
,
when
I
was
a
lad
.
I’d
not
long
come
prentice
to
old
Holman B-PER
(
him
being
my
dad’s
cousin
)
,
but
he
had
me
up
at
Bag B-LOC
End I-LOC
helping
him
to
keep
folks
from
tram
pling
and
trapessing
all
over
the
garden
while
the
sale
was
on
.
And
in
the
middle
of
it
all
Mr.
Bilbo B-PER
comes
up
the
Hill B-LOC
with
a
pony
and
some
mighty
big
bags
and
a
couple
of
chests
.
I
don’t
doubt
they
were
mostly
full
of
treasure
he
had
picked
up
in
foreign
parts
,
where
there
be
mountains
of
gold
,
they
say
;
but
there
wasn’t
enough
to
fill
tunnels
.
But
my
lad
Sam
will
know
more
about
that
.
He’s
in
and
out
of
Bag B-LOC
End I-LOC
.
Crazy
about
stories
of
the
old
days
,
he
is
,
and
he
listens
to
all
Mr.
Bilbo’s B-PER
tales
.
Mr.
Bilbo B-PER
has
learned
him
his
letters
meaning
no
harm
,
mark
you
,
and
I
hope
no
harm
will
come
of
it
.
Elves
and
Dragons
!
I
says
to
him
.
Cabbages
and
potatoes
are
better
for
me
and
yon
.
Don’t
go
getting
mixed
up
in
the
business
of
your
betters
,
or
you’ll
land
in
trouble
too
big
for
you
,
I
says
to
him
.
And
I
might
say
it
to
others
,
’
he
added
with
a
look
at
the
stranger
and
the
miller
.
But
the
Gaffer B-PER
did
not
convince
his
audience
.
The
legend
of
Bilbo’s B-PER
wealth
was
now
too
firmly
fixed
in
the
minds
of
the
younger
generation
of
hobbits B-OTH
.
Ah
,
but
he
has
likely
enough
been
adding
to
what
he
brought
at
first
,
’
argued
the
miller
,
voicing
common
opinion
.
He’s
often
away
from
home
.
And
look
at
the
outlandish
folk
that
visit
him
:
dwarves B-OTH
coming
at
night
,
and
that
old
wandering
conjuror
,
Gandalf B-PER
,
and
all
.
You
can
say
what
you
like
,
Gaffer B-PER
,
but
Bag B-LOC
End’s I-LOC
a
queer
place
,
and
its
folk
are
queerer
.
’
And
you
can
say
what
you
like
,
about
what
you
know
no
more
of
than
you
do
of
boating
,
Mr.
Sandyman B-PER
,
’
retorted
the
Gaffer B-PER
,
disliking
the
miller
even
more
than
usual
.
If
that’s
being
queer
,
then
we
could
do
with
a
bit
more
queerness
in
these
parts
.
There’s
some
not
far
away
that
wouldn’t
offer
a
pint
of
beer
to
a
friend
,
if
they
lived
in
a
hole
with
golden
walls
.
But
they
do
things
proper
at
Bag B-LOC
End I-LOC
.
Our
Sam B-PER
says
that
everyone’s
going
to
be
invited
to
the
party
,
and
there’s
going
to
be
presents
,
mark
you
,
presents
for
all
this
very
month
as
is
.
’
That
very
month
was
September
,
and
as
fine
as
you
could
ask
.
A
day
or
two
later
a
rumour
(
probably
started
by
the
knowledgeable
Sam B-PER
)
was
spread
about
that
there
were
going
to
be
fireworks
fireworks
,
what
is
more
,
such
as
had
not
been
seen
in
the
Shire B-LOC
for
nigh
on
a
century
,
not
indeed
since
the
Old B-PER
Took I-PER
died
.
Days
passed
and
The
Day
drew
nearer
.
An
odd
looking
waggon
laden
with
odd
looking
packages
rolled
into
Hobbiton B-LOC
one
evening
and
toiled
up
the
Hill B-LOC
to
Bag B-LOC
End I-LOC
.
The
startled
hobbits B-OTH
peered
out
of
lamplit
doors
to
gape
at
it
.
It
was
driven
by
outlandish
folk
,
singing
strange
songs
:
dwarves
with
long
beards
and
deep
hoods
.
A
few
of
them
remained
at
Bag B-LOC
End I-LOC
.
